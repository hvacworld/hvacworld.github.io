<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
