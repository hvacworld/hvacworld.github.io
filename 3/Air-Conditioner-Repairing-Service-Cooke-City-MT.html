<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power needs to not exceed the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, considering that the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not simple, since it takes into account not only the small power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
