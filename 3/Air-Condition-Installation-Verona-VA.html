A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of a number of spaces with one external unit. In the outdoor system of this a/c unit there is a more effective compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor systems found in the room.<p>
<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones.
