<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise a choice for homeowners to think about. Many times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally just available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best alternative for property owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
