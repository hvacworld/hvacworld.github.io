<h3>Facts All Valleyford WA Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Sean was very useful. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
