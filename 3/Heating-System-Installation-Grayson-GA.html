<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics lately, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
