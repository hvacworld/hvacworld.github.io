<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices maker's to ensure your factory warranties remain in location. Moreover, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often tough to quantify, as one response stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c don't just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repetitive use of a part that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, causing holes and fractures. , if that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.. an extremely advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
