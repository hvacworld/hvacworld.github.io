<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on.
