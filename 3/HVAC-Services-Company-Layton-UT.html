<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Layton UT</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in home construction is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofing systems. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor contaminants exhaust them from the house.<p>

The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
