<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 ought to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
