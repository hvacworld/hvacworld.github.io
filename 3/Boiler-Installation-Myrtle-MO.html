<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
<h3>Air Condition Installation Near Me in Myrtle MO</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place. Furthermore, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one action mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the result of recurring use of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.  a very helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
