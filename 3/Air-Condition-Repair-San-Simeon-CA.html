<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Given that the 1980s, producers of HVAC devices have actually been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more effective.
