<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested.
