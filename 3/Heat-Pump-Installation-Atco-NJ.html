Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the traditional water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank.

Set up unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>
