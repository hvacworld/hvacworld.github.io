<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
