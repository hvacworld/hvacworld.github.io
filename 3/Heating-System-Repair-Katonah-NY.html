<h3>Ventilation Systems in Katonah NY</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they identified the problem and repaired extremely rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Dirty Filters: â $ " Â Filters clogged with dust, family pet hair and other particles cause issues like failure to offer appropriate heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time. If you find the issue and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. Do It Yourself filter replacement alternatives range from $3 to $40, and you get what you pay for. That might be a very expensive dirty-filter diagnosis if the technician comes to your house. This sort of cleaning work need to be performed in a regular basis, so a furnace tune-up is required, check our Furnace Tune-Up Cost Guide to see its cost.<p>
