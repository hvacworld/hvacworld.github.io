<p>You must always employ an expert to perform AC repair, for the very same factor that you trust an expert plumbing professional or electrical expert.

<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same.

Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
