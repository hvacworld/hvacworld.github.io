<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
