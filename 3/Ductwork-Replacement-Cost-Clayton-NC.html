<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and large homes. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, because the absence of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
