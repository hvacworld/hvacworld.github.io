<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate however a less efficient collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the maker's directions.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. When radon ends up being caught in buildings and concentrations build up inside your home, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>
