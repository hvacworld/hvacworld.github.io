Lastly, the very best times of the year to set up a central heating system are in the spring and summer season.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
