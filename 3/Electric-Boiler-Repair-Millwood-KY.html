Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
