<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
