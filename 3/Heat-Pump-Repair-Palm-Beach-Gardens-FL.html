When ventilation is not adequate to account for an increase in the number of employees in the area, stagnant air may also be an issue.<p>
<p>Great Product! Shipment was sort of weird being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we dealt with issues. I would suggest this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the very first time.

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
