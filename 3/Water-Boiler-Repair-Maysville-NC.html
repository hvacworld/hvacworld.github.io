<p>Bear in mind that the SEER score is calculated utilizing the same set of temperature levels across the board. The average summer temperature to arrive at the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the appropriate SEER ranking for your area, subtract 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score has to be at least 13 for all new air conditioning units made in the United States.<p>

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might select to replace the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit. Speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit if you do so. However, considering current modifications in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it might be smarter to replace the entire system.<p>
