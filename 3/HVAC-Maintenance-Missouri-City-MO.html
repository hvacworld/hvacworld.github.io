However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
