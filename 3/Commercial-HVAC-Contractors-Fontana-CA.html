<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was type of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we resolved concerns. I would recommend this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>We have been very happy with Integrity's devices (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten finished annual maintenance of our system). Trane heat pump has worked effectively and is so efficient that it significantly decreased our energy expenses - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The couple of times we require them for emergency situations they reacted rapidly and fixed the problem.<p>
