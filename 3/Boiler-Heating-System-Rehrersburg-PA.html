I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he assisted me difficulty shoot the concern. He is truthful, trustworthy, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to find a truthful AC man and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
