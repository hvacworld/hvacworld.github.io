<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
