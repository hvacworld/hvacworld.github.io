Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes.

Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.
