<h3>Advantages Of Hiring AC Repair Services in Conyers GA</h3>
<p>Among the main reasons a furnace will run continuously is because something is clogged or unclean Prior to trying to repair any problem, take some time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is good to go, inspect the furnace blower for blocking and tidy it. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it if this does not work. Contact a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
