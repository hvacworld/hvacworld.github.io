<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to offer enough changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
