<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the house.

An air toxin could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or moist carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care products.
