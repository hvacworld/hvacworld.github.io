<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Self-installation tends to develop more issues than it solves. In reality, it frequently triggers expert intervention anyway to correct a few of the issues that were developed throughout the installation.

Let G & S Heating Cooling & Electric deal with the whole HVAC installation process from the start, and you'll never ever need to stress over it being done incorrectly.<p>
<p>Another option to oil heating systems are gas heaters While oil is generally used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice between the 2 types. Gas furnaces cost about the very same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The genuine advantage of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing product purchased with the house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the assessment on a really cold day they killed the furnace declaring health risk reason and contractor laws for their choice. As a new home owner I have actually learned how to identify the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
