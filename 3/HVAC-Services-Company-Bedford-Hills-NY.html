<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than outside or commercial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
