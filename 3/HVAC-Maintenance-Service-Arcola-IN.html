<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, as opposed to commercial or outside settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the building. It might likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private spaces.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
