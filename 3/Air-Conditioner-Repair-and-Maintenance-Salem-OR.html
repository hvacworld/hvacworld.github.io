<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Salem OR</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my companies, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and sensible on cost. It's hard to discover a sincere AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Your Review This is my 3rd time using All the time. Ilan always makes himself offered - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is experienced with these gadgets). I have absolutely nothing however fantastic things to say - he has taken good care of my heating and AC requirements. Quick action - fast resolution.<p>
<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is likewise an option for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems include not just the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, since the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically just available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a great way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for house owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
