<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil.
