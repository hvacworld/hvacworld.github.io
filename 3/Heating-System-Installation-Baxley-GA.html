<p>Before you head out and purchase an a/c, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be installing the ac system? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioner be? Too big and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and shorten its life.

When shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are just a few of the aspects that you need to take into account. Each option can and will substantially affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to neglect any of them.<p>
