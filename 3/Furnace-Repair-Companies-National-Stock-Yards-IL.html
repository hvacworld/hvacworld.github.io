<p>Learn More About PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>

This kind of a/c unit also is used in small commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts come from indoors through the home's exterior wall or roof to connect with the packaged air conditioning system, which is typically situated outdoors. Packaged a/c frequently include electric heating coils or a gas furnace.
