<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, occasionally linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
