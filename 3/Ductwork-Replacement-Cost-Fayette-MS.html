<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in autos in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by qualified HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
