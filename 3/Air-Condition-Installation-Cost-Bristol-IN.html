<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
