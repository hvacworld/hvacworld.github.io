<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
