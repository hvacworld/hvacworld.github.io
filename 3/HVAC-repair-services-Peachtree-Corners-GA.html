<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
