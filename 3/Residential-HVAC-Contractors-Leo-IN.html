<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works however your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
