<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system.

That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
