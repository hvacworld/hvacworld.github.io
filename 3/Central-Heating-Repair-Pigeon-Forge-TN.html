<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be established to provide threshold signals. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your tracking devices to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to resolve the scenario instantly.<p>
<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is often important to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can in some cases be acquired by requesting copies of air tracking information from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this data may recognize possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on information may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
