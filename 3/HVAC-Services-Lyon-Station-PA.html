Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and excessive wetness, introduces outside air, keeps interior building air distributing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
