<h3>How to Maintain Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Smithfield KY</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant.

Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
