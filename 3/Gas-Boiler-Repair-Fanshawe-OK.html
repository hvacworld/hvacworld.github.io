<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
