<p>Buildings are designed or meant to respond actively to a few of these changes around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and preserve surface areas to improve their longevity, appearance, or performance. In other cases, such changes subtly or even drastically alter buildings in ways that might be important to their own integrity or their influence on structure occupants through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We may discover it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, specifically, a few of the methods used by researchers studying communities, in order to gain a boosted understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our structures.<p>

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
