<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, an expert service person must be required nearly any maintenance aside from routine cleaning. Central air conditioners need to be expertly checked and changed prior to the start of every cooling season. However, don't let your maintenance end with this yearly checkup. While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system operating at peak efficiency.<p>
