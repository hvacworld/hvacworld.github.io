<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
