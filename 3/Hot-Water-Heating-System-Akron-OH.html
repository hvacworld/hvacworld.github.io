<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning system to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
