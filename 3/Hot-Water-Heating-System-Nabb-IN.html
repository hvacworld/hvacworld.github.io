Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my home and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection results look great for braising and pipes quality.
