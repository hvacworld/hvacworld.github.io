<p>Today, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be living in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. There are a number of design techniques in use today; nevertheless, all ground source heat pumps run with comparable concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface area systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
