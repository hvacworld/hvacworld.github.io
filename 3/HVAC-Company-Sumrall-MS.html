<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Sumrall MS</h3>
<p>After residing in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the air conditioning. I went on and purchased this Carrier and I should say it does the job rather well.

The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Do not stress! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it just may require 24 volts of electrical power.

<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
