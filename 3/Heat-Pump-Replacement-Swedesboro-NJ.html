<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, since the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally just available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
