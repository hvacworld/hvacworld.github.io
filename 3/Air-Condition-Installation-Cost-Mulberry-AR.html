<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
