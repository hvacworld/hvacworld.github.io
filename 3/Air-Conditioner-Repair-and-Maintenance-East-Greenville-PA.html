<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>

The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
