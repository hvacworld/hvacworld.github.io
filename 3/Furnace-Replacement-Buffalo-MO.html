<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance check outs per year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and typically some other perks.
