<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, don't position the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it. Any air flow restriction will decrease the system's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>

<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more difficult to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
