<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
