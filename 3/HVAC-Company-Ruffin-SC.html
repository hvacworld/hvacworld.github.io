<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, a professional service individual need to be called for nearly any maintenance besides regular cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners must be professionally inspected and adjusted before the start of every cooling season. However, don't let your maintenance end with this yearly examination. While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system running at peak performance.<p>
