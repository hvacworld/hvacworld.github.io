<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
