<p>There are a lot of benefits to using a radiant heating system over a conventional forced air heating unit. Radiant heat systems tend to be far more energy effective than other heaters, for one thing. Forced air heater tend to experience things like duct leakages, which rob them of approximately 30% of their output.

<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

Geothermal heating depends on neither the sun nor the wind, however instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot.
