<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out.

<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Never Ignore Cross Hill SC</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes a lot more severe with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more standard kind of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heat pump during harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

The ideal humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern.

<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is usually greater than lots of heat pump alternatives, they can still be extremely effective, depending on the design you buy.
