<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
