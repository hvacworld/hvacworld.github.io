<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need fairly little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is vital to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank must be checked for leaks, the system needs to be flushed regularly to eliminate tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water locations). The systems must be inspected at least two times annually for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to get rid of dust collected in order to improve collector performance.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your financial investment by just using the services of a licensed contractor or a licensed representative from a service or merchant to do the installation. If you choose to attempt to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed individual to do the work, in most, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the air conditioning system. A voided guarantee won't do you any great should the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the get-go and work with a certified person with the experience to install the system.<p>
