<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
