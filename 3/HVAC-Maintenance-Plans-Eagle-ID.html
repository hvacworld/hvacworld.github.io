A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis.
