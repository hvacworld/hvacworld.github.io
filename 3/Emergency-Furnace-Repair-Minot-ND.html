<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Companies in Minot</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold might be residing in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. But a number of the important things individuals do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of airborne pollutants in their homes and worsen asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same period. Basically, SEER supplies more data based on how the EER performs in different temperatures. The higher the system's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>
