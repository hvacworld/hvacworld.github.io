<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary a/c) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
