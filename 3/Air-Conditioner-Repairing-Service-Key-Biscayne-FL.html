<p>A geothermal heating system does not generate its power by burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas, or oil. Instead, it soaks up heat from within the earth. Moreover, a geothermal heating & cooling system utilizes substantially less electrical power compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heat pump.

<p>Radiant heating systems do not utilize ducts, that makes them quite a bit more energy efficient than other systems. They also don't create hot and cold areas. All of the heat that radiant heating systems distribute moves through strong items, keeping the heat near the flooring of the room where it is the most use. Radiant heat systems can also heat spaces with less energy spent, and keep them warmed for longer, because many floors tend to maintain heat better than air does.<p>
