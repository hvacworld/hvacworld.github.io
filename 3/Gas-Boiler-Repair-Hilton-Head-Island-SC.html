<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
