Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality problems are not restricted to homes. In truth, many office buildings have substantial air contamination sources A few of these structures may be improperly ventilated.
