<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the convected heat system has been running for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in gathering info on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
