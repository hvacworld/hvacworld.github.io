<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
