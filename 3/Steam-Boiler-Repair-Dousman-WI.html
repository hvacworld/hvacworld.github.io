<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your cars and truck.

Throughout high usage months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might notice unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk with your medical professional about them. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
