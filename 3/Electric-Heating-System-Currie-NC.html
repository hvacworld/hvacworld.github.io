<h3>Electric Furnace in Currie NC</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00.

<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
