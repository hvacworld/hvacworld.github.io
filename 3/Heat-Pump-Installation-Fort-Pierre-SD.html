<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor devices through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of signs in numerous countless asthmatic kids, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year.

Exposure to secondhand smoke triggers throat, eye, and nose inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually linked exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest discomfort.
