<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
