(If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips.
