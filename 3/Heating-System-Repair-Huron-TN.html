Such a tool must determine the variety of people impacted; define ages and job descriptions of involved employees; figure out where they lie within the workplace; show when the symptoms occur (time of day, day of week, and time of year); offer a list of particular health signs or diseases; recognize all makers run in the workplace; show the type of outside air contamination; and recognize prospective sources of job tension.<p>
<p>We look at ideas before we offer recommendations to replace rather than repair a heating system. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing money by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Finally, if you do recognize a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heating unit and select to install it in your home, you could be qualified for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses. (And these costs can be significant. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, property owners can anticipate to pay in between $6 and $16 per square foot, not consisting of tax and labor, for a radiant heating system.) Consult the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Incentives for Renewable Resource (DSIRE) to see if there are refunds, loans or tax reductions available for the installation of a more efficient in-floor heating system where you live.<p>
