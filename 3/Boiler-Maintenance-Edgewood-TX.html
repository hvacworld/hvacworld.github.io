<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and tied them into a hot water supply.

<p>A customized air conditioning system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, given that all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is in fact heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>
