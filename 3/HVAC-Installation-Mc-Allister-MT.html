<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, houses and schools matters, particularly given that we spend most of our lives inside. A/c help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning system is extra-large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the ac system will require more energy to cool your house. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>

Plus, there's even an included cleaning benefit as keeping the spaces dust-free is easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
