<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
