<p>Radiant heat offers a number of unique benefits over forced air heating systems. For example, radiant heat systems are more energy effective than forced air systems. They don't have to fret about duct leakages, which are accountable for output losses of as much as 30% in other heating unit types. Transferring heat through strong items will also cause it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home warmed by a radiant system will heat up quicker, and remain warm with less energy spent. These are simply a few of the numerous benefits that a radiant heating system can provide you.<p>

They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working.
