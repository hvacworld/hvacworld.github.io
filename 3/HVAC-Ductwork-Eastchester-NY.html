<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
