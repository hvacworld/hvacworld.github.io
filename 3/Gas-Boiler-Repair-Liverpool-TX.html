Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>

To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
