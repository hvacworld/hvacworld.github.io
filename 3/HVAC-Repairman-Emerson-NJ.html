<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, instead of outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It may also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to private spaces.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps run on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heater (like an area heating system) with the exact same quantity of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
