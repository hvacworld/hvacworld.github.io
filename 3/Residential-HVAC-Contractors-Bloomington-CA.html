<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from procedures or items; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two need to not be confused.

The 2 operations utilize various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to accomplish its goals.<p>
