<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your home still heats up to the ideal temperature level.

Just be concerned if your house is not heating up. However, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you must employ a specialist to examine and repair the unit.<p>

Airborne lead goes into the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled.
