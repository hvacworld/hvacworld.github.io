<p>Central air units are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
