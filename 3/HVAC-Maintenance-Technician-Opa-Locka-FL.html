<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Given that cooling and heating work may also require installing or repairing pipes to provide oil or gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor may also be required to hold a separate plumber's license or have a licensed plumber on call. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors particularly for this kind of work. When getting a price quote, make sure to ask not only if a company is licensed, but likewise what type of license it holds.<p>

<p>Both should be kept tidy due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil.
