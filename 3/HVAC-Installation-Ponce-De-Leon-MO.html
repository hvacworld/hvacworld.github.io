<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Necessary Service in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% performance or better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient.

Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being common features of environment-friendly homes as part of the growing green building motion. Green projects represented 20 percent of all freshly constructed houses in the U.S. in 2015.

That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole real estate market.<p>

<p>Setting up cooling costs between $3,350 and $5,912 with many homeowners reporting spending $4,631 usually. This price is normal of setting up a new AC system to your forced air furnace.

<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not emit heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
