<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy efficient approaches of heating or cooling a house.

Underground temperature level stays constant no matter the climate, so geothermal systems offer consistent and dependable heating and cooling.<p>
