<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently.

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me concern and a lower rate.

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
