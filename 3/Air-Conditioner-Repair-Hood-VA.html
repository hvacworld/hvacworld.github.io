<h3>HVAC Technician in Hood VA</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they detected the problem and fixed very quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
