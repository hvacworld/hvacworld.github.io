<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable effect on occupants-- outdoors air should be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
