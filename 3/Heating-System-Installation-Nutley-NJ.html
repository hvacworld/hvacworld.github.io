In addition, citizens need to look out to the introduction of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth.

Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse.
