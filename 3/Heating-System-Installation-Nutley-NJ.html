<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to lower the quantity of energy required for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions should likewise be required to decrease contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, citizens need to look out to the introduction of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth.

<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ may see musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse.
