<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
