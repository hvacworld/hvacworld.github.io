<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (including carbon monoxide, radon, unpredictable natural compounds ), particulates, microbial impurities (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stressor that can induce negative health conditions. Source control, filtering and the use of ventilation to water down pollutants are the main approaches for improving indoor air quality in most structures.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
