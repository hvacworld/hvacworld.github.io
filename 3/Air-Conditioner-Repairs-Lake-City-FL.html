<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in location.

Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't just break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of repeated use of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, causing fractures and holes. , if that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.. a very helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
