<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. Be sure to have those measurements on hand when shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit conveniently into the window.
