They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece below.

This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
