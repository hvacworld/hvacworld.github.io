<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as simply radiant systems.

When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
