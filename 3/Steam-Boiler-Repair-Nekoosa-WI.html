<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a properly sized system. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
