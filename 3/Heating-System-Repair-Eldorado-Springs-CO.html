<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Eldorado Springs CO</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and a/c (HVAC) systems are as different as the different houses they serve (single family homes, duplexes, mobile homes, homes, high-rise condominiums, row real estate, and so on). No matter what the type of home HVAC system, appropriate air flow (ventilation), appropriate filtering, and humidity control all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is running safely and not contributing to or triggering an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
