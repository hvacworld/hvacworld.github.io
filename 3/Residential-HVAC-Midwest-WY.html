<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, search for signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can indicate your home might not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To spot odors in your home, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
