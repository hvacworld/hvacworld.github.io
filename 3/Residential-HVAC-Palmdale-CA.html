<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall.

Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions since they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Because an unit is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
