<p>If no impurity sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stagnant air" conditions.

Stagnant air might also be a problem when ventilation is not enough to account for a boost in the variety of workers in the location.<p>
<p>People who dislike these contaminants ought to utilize allergen-proof bed mattress encasements, wash bedding in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and prevent room furnishings that build up dust, especially if they can not be cleaned in hot water.

Using central vacuum systems that are vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high performance filters might also be of assistance.<p>
