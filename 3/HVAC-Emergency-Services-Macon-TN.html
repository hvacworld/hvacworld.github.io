<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>It is then wise to veterinarian the recommended contractors by researching and using a service like Update to instantly compare several quotes from the leading HVAC contractors.
