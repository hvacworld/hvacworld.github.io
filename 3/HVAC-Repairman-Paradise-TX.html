<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes.

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
