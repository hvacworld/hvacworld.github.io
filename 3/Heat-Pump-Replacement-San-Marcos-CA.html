<h3>Leaking Ductwork in San Marcos CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
