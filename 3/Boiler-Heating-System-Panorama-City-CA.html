<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it could flatter twice the electrical power that even a low-end new one would use. That's since it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices set up just a couple of years ago.<p>
