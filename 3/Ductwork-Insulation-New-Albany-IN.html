<p>Among the downsides of central heating is that it's possibly costly to set up, especially in an older home. Depending upon the type of unit installed, it can be loud and trigger problems if you're highly allergic to dust. In addition, certain fuels and devices may need special licenses, and there is limited flexibility in the event of altered heating requirements. Throughout usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the home.<p>

<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis might end up being stopped up, lowering air flow quality, volume, and circulation. They also might end up being places for molds and germs to be and grow distributed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be effectively kept to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
