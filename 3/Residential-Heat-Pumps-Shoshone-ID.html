<p>My oldest boy always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The noise level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service contract tries to upsell you each time they pertain to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months before the current one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
