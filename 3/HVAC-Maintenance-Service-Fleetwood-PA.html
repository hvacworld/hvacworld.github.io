To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work.

<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have been shown to trigger the health effects discussed. Nevertheless, it is not always true that the results noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels normally discovered in the house. In many cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health results is too minimal to figure out the levels at which the listed results could take place.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might see musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that frequently, our nationally representative study discovered. Roughly 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
