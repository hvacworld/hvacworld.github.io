<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>

On the other hand, in huge box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the truth of a cruel, vicious summer.<p>
