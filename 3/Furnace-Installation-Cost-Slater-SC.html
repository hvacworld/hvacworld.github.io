<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has actually become an essential problem to homeowners and health specialists. Indoor air contamination research studies have recognized a number of pollutants that can be present in indoor air.

Proper ventilation and removal of the sources of these contaminants are very important in maintaining excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The first ac system and refrigerators employed combustible or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<h3>Central Air Conditioning Companies in Slater SC</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the visit. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperatures reach freezing.

The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>

Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
