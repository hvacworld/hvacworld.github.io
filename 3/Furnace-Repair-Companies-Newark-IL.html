<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
