Outbreaks in medical centers and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
