<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is an extremely enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater because the technicians thought they just didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
