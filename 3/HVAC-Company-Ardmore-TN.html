<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter when every 3 months. During high use months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>
