<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
