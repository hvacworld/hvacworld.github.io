<h3>Furnace Service in Toccoa Falls GA</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Toccoa Falls GA?</h3>
<p>Sean was really useful. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Clogged rain gutters can lead to water seeping into your home, leading to mold development, according to the EPA.
