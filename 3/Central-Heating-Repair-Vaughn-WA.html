<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
