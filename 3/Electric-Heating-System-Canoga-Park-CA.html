<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in location. Moreover, the concrete results of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one action stated the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not just break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of repeated use of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to cracks and holes.
