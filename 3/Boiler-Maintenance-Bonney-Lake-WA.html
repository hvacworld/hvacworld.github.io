<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioning And Heating Companies in Bonney Lake WA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
