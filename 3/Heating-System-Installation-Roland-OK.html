Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Oftentimes, if products have actually stopped working to dry a number of days after the believed water event, mold development is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not right away visible.
