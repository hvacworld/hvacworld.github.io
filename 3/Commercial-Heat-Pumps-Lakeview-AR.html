<p>Great Item! Shipment was kind of weird being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: buy advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we dealt with problems. I would advise this product to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<p>Many commercial buildings utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that are part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can also utilize natural ventilation by opening doors or windows. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outside air introduced into an area per an unit of time, and is typically expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm).
