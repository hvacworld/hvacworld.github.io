If you have access to cheap or free firewood, or you cut your own wood from your woodlot, it may not cost you anything.

<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
