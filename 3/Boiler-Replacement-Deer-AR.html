<h3>Air Conditioning And Heating Companies in Deer AR</h3>
<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions must likewise be taken to reduce pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, locals should look out to the development of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization procedures need to not be undertaken till these issues have been remedied.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke causes eye, nose, and throat irritation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually connected direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
