<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Necessary Organisation in Los Angeles.

<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Heating systems resemble automobiles. As they age, you can change one part only need another part changed or fixed next year. It does not take long to invest $500 just to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Furnaces incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair sign is whether you had to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be truly cold on a below zero night.<p>

<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
