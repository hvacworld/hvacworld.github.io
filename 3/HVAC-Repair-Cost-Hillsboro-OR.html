<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur with time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
