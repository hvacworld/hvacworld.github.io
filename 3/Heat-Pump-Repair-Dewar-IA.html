A ductless system has a built-in performance benefit because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions since they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy.
