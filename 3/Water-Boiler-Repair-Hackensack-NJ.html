<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as near the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
