<p>There's a huge difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common form of house heating-- convection. Over the previous century, the majority of homes in colder environments were warmed by convection, instead of radiation.

In turn, the items in the room, like furniture and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
