<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements.
