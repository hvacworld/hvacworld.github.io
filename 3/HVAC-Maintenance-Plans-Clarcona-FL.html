Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
