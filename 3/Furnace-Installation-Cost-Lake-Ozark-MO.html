<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps operate on electricity and work like ac system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like an area heating unit) with the same amount of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
