<p>Simplify your services, earn more services profits, and provide an incredible customer experience. To ensure the unit you choose is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load estimation estimate to determine the specific type of heat and cooling system that's just right for your home-we don't just replace it with the exact same size unit you currently have. These estimations take into account things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is important so the system isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>Radiant heating offers a number of unique advantages over forced air heating systems. For example, radiant heat systems are more energy effective than forced air systems. They do not have to fret about duct leaks, which are responsible for output losses of approximately 30% in other heater types. Transmitting heat through strong objects will likewise cause it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A house heated by a glowing system will warm up faster, and remain warm with less energy spent. These are simply a few of the many advantages that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>
