An oversize compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
