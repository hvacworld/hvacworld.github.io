<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stale air may likewise be an issue when ventilation is not adequate to account for an increase in the number of workers in the area.<p>
