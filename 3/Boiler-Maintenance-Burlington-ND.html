<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be extreme. They include hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, kids, and babies are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups since lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the harmful impacts of lead. Kids might have higher exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few affordable ones got.
