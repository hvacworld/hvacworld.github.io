The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your house still heats to the right temperature level.

However, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you should contact a specialist to check and repair the unit.<p>
