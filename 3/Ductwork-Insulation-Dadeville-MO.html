<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
