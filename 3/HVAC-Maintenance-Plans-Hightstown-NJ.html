<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Hightstown NJ</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
