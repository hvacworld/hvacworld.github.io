Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
