<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate because it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>

<p>I have actually been using them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He assisted me problem shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is honest, trustworthy, and affordable on rate. It's tough to discover a sincere AC man and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
