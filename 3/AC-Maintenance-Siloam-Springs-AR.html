<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
