<h3>Heating And Cooling Companies in Dumfries VA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
<p>With the cost of electrical power and gas increasing, it's important to have your furnace tuned-up for maximum energy savings. This will keep you from needlessly paying more than you should.
