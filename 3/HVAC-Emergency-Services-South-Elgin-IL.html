<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
