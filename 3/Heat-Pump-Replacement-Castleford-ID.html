<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, given that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally just offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best alternative for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
