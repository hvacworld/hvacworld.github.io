<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.
