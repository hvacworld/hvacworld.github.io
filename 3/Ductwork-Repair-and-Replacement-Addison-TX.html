<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution.

The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
