<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
