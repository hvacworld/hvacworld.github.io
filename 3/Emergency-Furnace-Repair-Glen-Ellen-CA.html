<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
