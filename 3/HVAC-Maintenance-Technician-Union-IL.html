The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can afford, a lot of Seattleites need to find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens.

<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
