<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a referral in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
