<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my demand.

Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years back and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.
