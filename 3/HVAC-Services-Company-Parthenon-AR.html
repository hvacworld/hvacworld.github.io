<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

Checking for lots of contaminants can be pricey. Before monitoring your house for toxins besides radon, consult your state or local health department or professionals who have experience in fixing indoor air quality issues in nonindustrial structures.<p>

Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Experts suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and typically are better suited for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
