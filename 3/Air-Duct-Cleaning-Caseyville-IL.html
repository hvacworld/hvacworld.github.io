<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the system. Loose, faulty or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves examining the suggested connections in addition to temperature and pressure assesses.

Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new construction (homes typically use between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load.

<p>Making use of air filters can trap a few of the air pollutants.

<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
