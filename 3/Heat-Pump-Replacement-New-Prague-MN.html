<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They include delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, children, and babies are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups given that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

A foundation like that and an enthusiasm to do the right thing is what makes our company what it is today. A Leading Technological HVAC believed leader and the only place to get a 5 year part guarantee with repairs.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
