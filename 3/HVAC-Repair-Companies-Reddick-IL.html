<p>The toxins noted in this guide have been revealed to cause the health impacts mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily true that the effects kept in mind take place at the pollutant concentration levels usually discovered in the home. Oftentimes, our understanding of the pollutants and their health results is too restricted to determine the levels at which the listed impacts might occur.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline allergen might induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have feline allergies.<p>
