An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
