It is a great opportunity; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on uncommon celebrations.<p>
