<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power should not go beyond the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, considering that the overall capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not basic, given that it considers not just the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
