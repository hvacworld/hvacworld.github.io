Since it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
