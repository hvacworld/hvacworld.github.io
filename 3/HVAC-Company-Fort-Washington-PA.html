<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized various methodologies. The CMHC research study called on numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they became part of a research study, and the researchers did not manage for time spent or methods utilized. The EPA research study prescribed and controlled methods utilized on a smaller variety of houses. While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have defects, no other research has actually challenged the findings. And although the equipment and techniques utilized by duct-cleaning companies have altered given that these studies were performed, the duct in homes have not.<p>
<p>Since cooling and heating work might also need installing or repairing plumbing to provide oil or gas to heating equipment, an HVAC contractor might also be needed to hold a different plumbing professional's license or have a licensed plumber on call.

When getting a quote, be sure to ask not just if a company is licensed, but likewise what type of license it holds.<p>
