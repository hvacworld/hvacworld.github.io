<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might discover musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new houses are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outside air into the house. A few of these designs consist of energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (likewise known as air-to-air heat exchangers).
