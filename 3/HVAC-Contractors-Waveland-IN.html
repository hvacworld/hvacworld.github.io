<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
