A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently.

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
