Because the energy used to heat your house is drawn out straight from the ground, it protects the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or toxins. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems similar to those utilized in fridges. While geothermal systems do use some electricity, they release far less greenhouse gases or other toxins than heating systems that require natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health results pointed out. However, it is not always true that the impacts kept in mind occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the house. In many cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health results is too minimal to determine the levels at which the listed results could happen.<p>
