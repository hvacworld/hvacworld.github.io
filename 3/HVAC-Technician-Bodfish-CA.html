Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
