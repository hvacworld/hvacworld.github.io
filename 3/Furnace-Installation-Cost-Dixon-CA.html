Typically they were initially thinking about from another location keeping track of some other aspect of their buildings, such as energy use, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't until later, as they continued working with us, that they found out about and implemented indoor air quality keeping an eye on to provide a much healthier, much safer building environment-- and to head off the unfavorable repercussions connected with indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
