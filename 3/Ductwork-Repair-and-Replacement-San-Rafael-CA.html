<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Company in San Rafael</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated effectiveness benefit. Because they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
