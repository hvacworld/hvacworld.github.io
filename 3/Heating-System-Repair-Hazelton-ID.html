<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been effectively dried.
