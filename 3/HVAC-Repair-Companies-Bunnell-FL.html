<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We decided on getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
