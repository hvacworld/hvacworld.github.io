<h3>Heat And Air Units Repair in Wade NC</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
