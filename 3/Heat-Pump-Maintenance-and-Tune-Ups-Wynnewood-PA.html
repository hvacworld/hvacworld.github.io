<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most inexpensive if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
