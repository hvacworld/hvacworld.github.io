<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
