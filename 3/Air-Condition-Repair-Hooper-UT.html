Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
