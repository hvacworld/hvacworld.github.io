<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has actually ended up being a crucial concern to property owners and health professionals. Indoor air pollution studies have determined several impurities that can be present in indoor air. These consist of combustion items, volatile natural substances (consisting of formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Appropriate ventilation and elimination of the sources of these pollutants are necessary in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the conventional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, make certain that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available. It is most likely that it is supported by the pipes if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>
