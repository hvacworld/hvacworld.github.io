<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
