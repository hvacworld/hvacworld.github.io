<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a range of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has recognized building materials, home furnishings, and mold as major issues, however much of the risk also comes from burning things. For example, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can create contamination in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly huge problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Think about potential effects of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the producer's instructions, specifically directions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system effectively adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indication of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While an area heater is in use, open a door from the room where the heating system is located to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
