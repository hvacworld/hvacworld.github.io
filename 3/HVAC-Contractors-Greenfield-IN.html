<p>As one of the most crucial financial investments and tools in your house, it pays to monitor simply how efficiently and successfully your warm air oil or natural gas furnace is running. You need to understand when to change it before it costs you more in repairs than a brand-new purchase or if it ends up being unsafe.

<p>The rest of the HVAC system also needs to be in leading condition for the air conditioning unit to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the home.

Sealing leaks in ductwork can enhance HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler house in the hot summer season.<p>
