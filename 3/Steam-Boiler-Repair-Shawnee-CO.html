In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water.

Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
