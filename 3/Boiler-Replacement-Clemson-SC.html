The main path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads.

Outbreaks in medical facilities and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis.
