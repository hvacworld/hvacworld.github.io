<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same contaminants. In other words, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for distributing cold and hot air throughout your house, supplying a comfy climate in every space.
