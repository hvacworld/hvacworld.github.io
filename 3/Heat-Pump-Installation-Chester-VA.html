<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is usually greater than many heat pump options, they can still be extremely effective, depending on the model you purchase. Among the primary advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion procedure, it will heat the air to higher temperatures than other heating options. This suggests it can warm up your home to the desired temperature level quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
