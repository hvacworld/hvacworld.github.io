<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
