<p>A specific air conditioning system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a standard ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the very same air course. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
