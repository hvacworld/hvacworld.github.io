<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
