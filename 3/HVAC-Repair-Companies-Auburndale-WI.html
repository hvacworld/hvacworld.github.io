<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The main factor house owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the amount of services offered. If the system is brand-new and still under a producer's guarantee, the cost might not be rewarding. Any significant repairs should be covered under the manufacturer's service warranty.
