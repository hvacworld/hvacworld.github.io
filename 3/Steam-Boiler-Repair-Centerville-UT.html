<p>Some HVAC service technicians offer service agreements to their clients, providing regular maintenance of heating and cooling systems.

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Centerville UT?</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
