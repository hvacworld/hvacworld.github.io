<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
