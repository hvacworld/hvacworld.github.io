<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating units are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>1. Central Air Conditioning Source Heat Pumps Air source heatpump work best in a mild environment, where the temperature doesn't get too expensive or too low.
