<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
