<p>Geothermal heatpump are incredibly efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Just like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling result. Many ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for each system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 units are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
