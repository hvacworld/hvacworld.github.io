<p>Specializing in commercial and residential air conditioning installation, All the time Cooling & Heating, Inc. is dedicated to keeping clients in Rye Brook, NY nice and cool. No job is small or too big, and we aim to deliver complete customer complete satisfaction on every project we carry out. We also offer a broad selection of air conditioning system models at cost effective costs to fulfill your specific needs.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
