<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who reside in the home. Contaminants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into your home from the ground listed below. An air toxin might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care products. Viruses and bacteria, animal dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Filters can get filthy easily, especially if you live in a location that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, debris, germs, and tidy the air. They are accountable for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and changed frequently, your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you expect it to.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
