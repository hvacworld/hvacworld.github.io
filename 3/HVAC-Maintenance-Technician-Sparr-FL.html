<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that frequently, our nationally representative survey discovered. Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never clean their humidifier or cooking area variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
