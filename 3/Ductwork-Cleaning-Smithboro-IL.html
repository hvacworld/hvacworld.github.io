Loose, malfunctioning or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace includes checking the recommended connections in addition to temperature and pressure evaluates.

<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly straightforward procedure.
