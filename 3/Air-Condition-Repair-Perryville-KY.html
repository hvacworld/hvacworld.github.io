<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires handled by experts, see Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
