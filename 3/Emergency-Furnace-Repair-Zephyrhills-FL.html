Chemical toxins can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the building (e.g., office equipment; floor, furnishings and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
