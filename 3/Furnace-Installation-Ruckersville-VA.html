<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Company in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year ago and they have actually been to your house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced fairly, have handled the one repair I needed well, and are expert and always on-time. Have actually been through a few companies over the years and Wachoff's is certainly the very best I have actually had the opportunity to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been fantastic.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
