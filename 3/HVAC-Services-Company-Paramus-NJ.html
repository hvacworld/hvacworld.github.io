PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room cooling provides optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
