<h3>Air Condition Installation Near Me in Gurnee IL</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>

<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. Once the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly cure and harden-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
