<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " primary ecological risk to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled.
