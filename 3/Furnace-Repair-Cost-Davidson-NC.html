<p>Recently, Target told press reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial invasion into its systems was traced back to network qualifications that were stolen from a 3rd party supplier. Sources now inform KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in question was a refrigeration, heating and air  conditioning subcontractor that has worked at a variety of areas at Target and other leading merchants.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they diagnosed the problem and repaired very quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors.
