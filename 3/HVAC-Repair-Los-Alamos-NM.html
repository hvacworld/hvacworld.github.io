<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Los Alamos NM Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in house building and construction is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in roofings, walls, and floors. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
