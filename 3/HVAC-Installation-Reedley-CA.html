<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the building or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside.
