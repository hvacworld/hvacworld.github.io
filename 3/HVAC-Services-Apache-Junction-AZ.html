<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Apache Junction AZ Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>When you and your family walk into your house in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfortable as you can be? Do you discover it to be either too cold during the winter season or too warm in locations throughout the summer season?

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
