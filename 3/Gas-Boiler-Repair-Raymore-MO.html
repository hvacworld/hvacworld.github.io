<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most economical if your house or building has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently higher salaries for air conditioning tradespersons. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or merely a high level of competition for skilled trades.

The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those procedures include bringing in outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
