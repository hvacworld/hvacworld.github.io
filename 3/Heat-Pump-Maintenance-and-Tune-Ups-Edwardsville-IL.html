<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Edwardsville IL</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
