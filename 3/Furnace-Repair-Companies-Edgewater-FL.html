<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget-friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Next, and possibly simply as essential when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
