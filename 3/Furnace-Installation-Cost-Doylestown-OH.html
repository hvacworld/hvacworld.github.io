<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices producer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place. Furthermore, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one response stated the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive use of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  an extremely beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
