<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
