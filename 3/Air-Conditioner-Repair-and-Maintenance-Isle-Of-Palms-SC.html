<h3>What You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair at Isle Of Palms SC</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
