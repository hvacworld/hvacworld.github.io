<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might see unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk to your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
