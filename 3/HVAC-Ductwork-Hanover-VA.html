Others were almost two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up team was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install inspection results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
