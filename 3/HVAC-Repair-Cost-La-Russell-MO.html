<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not provide them.. Secondly like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
