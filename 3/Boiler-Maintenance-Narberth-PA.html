<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
