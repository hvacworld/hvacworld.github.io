<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts years, because it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
