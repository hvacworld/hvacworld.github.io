<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Aurora OR</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Some health impacts can be useful indicators of an indoor air quality issue, particularly if they appear after an individual moves to a brand-new house, remodels or refurnishes a home, or deals with a house with pesticides.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day.

I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
