<h3>How to Select An Expert HVAC Tech in Orange Lake FL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Room air conditioners feature a thermostat sensing unit, situated behind the control board, which determines the temperature level of air coming into the evaporative coil. The air conditioner could cycle constantly or act erratically if the sensing unit is knocked out of position. The sensing unit needs to be near the coil but not touching it; adjust its position by carefully flexing the wire that holds it in place.<p>
