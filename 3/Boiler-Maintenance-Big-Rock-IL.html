<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>

For example, humans breathe out carbon dioxide, which in small amounts is not hazardous, however may become harmful if high concentrations are enabled to build up. Germs or micro-organisms might also be present within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the whole office or structure by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
