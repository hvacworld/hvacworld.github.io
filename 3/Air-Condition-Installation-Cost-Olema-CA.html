<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works in Olema CA?</h3>
<p>Even newer furnaces less than 5 years of ages have been discovered as bad. A lot of house owners are surprised to find out that their 'new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger. In many cases it is because of bad furnace design, but in many cases, it's from neglect.

The Efficiency Check-Up (see previous response above) is also crucial to your furnace's life expectancy.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
