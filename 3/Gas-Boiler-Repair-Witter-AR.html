<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
