After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve money over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as conventional air-source systems. The lack of moving parts means you're less likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're substantially more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
