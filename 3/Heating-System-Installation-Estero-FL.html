<h3>HVAC Filters in Estero FL</h3>
<p>I have been using them for many years for my services, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is truthful, trusted, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to find an honest AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an uncommonly high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had identified the trouble location in examining the expense. He resolved the concern in one day, had changed the costs to what I considered reasonable before he recalled, understood what may have caused the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not happen once again. I have thought about All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience verifies that.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: They were great! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested.
