<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this enter the backyards of homes. With split system units, most of the elements are housed in a metal box beyond the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal elements too. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous rooms simultaneously, but are not very energy effective.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
