Insufficient ventilation also takes place if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or positioned in such a method that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of structure residents. Poorly located outside air intake vents can likewise bring in air polluted with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms.

An example of time control is setting up flooring waxing and removing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday.

Place control includes moving the toxin source away from residents and even moving susceptible occupants.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
