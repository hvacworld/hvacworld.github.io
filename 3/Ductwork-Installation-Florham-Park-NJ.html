<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget-friendly. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
