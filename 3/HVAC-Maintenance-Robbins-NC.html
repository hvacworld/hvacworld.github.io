<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
