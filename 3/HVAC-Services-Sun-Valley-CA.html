<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions need to also be required to minimize pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.) In addition, locals need to be alert to the development of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization procedures must not be undertaken until these issues have been fixed.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator requires managed by experts, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
