<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably lowers direct exposure to toxins throughout cooking. Incorrect adjustment, often shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Think about buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly if you buy a new gas stove or variety. Never use a gas range to heat your house. Constantly make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment).

In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
