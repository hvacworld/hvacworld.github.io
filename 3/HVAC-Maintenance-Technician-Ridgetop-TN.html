<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).
