Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been tied to signs like headaches, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some particular illness have actually been linked to specific air impurities or indoor environments, like asthma with wet indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger instant symptoms however can lead to cancer after many years.<p>

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Petersburg TN</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. First, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
