When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy.

In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
