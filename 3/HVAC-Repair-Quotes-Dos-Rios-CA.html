Not just was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
