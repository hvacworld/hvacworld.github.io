<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
