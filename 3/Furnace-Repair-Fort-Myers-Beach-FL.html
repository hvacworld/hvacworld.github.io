<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
