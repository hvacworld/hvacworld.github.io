Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar.

The number of hours it takes typically triggers the repair to be more expensive than the furnace was or a brand-new one would be.

<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Sonoma CA</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the check out. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
<p>A/c service consultations cover a long list of checks in, on and around your devices.

<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct.

When the ac system works however your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
