The key part of your air conditioning is the outdoor unit. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its placement on your home and its maintenance, it might sustain some damage during the winter. Most of the time, this just consists of some accumulation of dirt and particles, which is pretty easy to eliminate. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the outside of the system and make sure that there is no rust, damage from accumulated wetness, or excessive wear to the outside. They may advise that you trim thick trees or bushes to ensure adequate airflow around the unit.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work.

He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
