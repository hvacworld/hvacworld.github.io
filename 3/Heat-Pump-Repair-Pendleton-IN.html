HVAC professionals advise following this standard rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
