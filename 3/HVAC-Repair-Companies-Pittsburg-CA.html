<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners are more efficient than room a/c unit. In addition, they run out the way, quiet, and hassle-free to operate. To save energy and money, you should try to buy an energy-efficient ac system and reduce your central air conditioner's energy usage. In an average air-conditioned house, a/c consumes more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, triggering power plants to emit about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>
