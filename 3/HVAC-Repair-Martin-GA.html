<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
