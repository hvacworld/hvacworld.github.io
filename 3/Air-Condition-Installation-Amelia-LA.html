<p>Next, and perhaps just as essential when it comes to central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
