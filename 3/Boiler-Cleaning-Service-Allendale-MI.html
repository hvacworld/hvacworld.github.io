<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.

This company presented a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes.

R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, however is still imported and can be acquired and used by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
