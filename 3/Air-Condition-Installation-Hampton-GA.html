Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family house installation organisation totally flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with beginners more familiar with AC living.

This could be through a public offering, a sale to a big organisation in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management.
