<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, considering that it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>

At lower levels of exposure, CO causes moderate effects that are frequently mistaken for the influenza. These signs consist of headaches, lightheadedness, nausea, fatigue and disorientation. The impacts of CO direct exposure can differ significantly from individual to person depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
