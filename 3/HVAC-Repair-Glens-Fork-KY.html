<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Care Tips in Glens Fork KY</h3>
<p>When developing your new home a well-functioning Cooling and heating system is important, in addition to the air quality you breathe within. We have the experience and resources essential to help from the preparation stages through to the final installation. We utilize the current software to help design your ductwork system and utilize the greatest quality materials in the building and installation.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
