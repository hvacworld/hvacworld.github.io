<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square video footage. They utilize a series of estimations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs needed to heat the area. The bigger the space, the more effective the home heating unit needs to be.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
