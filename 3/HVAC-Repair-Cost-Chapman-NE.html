<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
