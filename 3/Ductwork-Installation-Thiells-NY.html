<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
