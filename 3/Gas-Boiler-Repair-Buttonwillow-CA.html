<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
