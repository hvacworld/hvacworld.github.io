<h3>Discontinue Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water in Ballston Lake NY</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else could come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to purchase it. My other half stated that she had actually seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
