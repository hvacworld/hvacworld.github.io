<h3>Advantages Of Hiring AC Repair Services in Midway UT</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We selected getting something more pricey than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
