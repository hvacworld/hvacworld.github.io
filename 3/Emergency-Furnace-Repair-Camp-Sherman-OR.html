My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, see Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
