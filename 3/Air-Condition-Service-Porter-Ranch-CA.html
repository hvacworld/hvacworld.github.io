<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
