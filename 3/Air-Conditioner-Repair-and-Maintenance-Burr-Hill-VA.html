<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>

He committed to the job based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday).
