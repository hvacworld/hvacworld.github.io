An air contaminant might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or moist carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items.
