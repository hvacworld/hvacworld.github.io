<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
