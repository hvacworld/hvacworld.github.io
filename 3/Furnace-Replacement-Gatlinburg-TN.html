<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely handy in gathering details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to briefly deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.
