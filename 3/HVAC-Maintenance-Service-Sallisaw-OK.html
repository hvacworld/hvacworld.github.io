<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and efficiency if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to search for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters.

If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread out throughout the whole work environment or building by ways of the ventilation system.<p>
