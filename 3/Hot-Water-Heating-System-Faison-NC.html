<h3>Window Air Conditioner in Faison NC</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a fast web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>
