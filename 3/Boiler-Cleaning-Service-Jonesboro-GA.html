<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed just a few years ago.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they utilize air to exchange heat, in the very same way as a car radiator or common household air conditioning unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>
