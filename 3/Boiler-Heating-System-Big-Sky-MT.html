<p>Air flow patterns in structure are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects.

Even if the opening is little, air will move until the inside pressure amounts to the outside.<p>

For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early deterioration, causing holes and fractures.
