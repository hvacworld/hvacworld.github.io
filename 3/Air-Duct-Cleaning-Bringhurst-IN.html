<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Disease (BRI) describes less frequent (however often more serious) cases of individuals ending up being ill after remaining in a specific building at a specific time. In these cases, there is usually a comparable set of scientific signs experienced by the people and a clear cause can frequently be found upon investigation. Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI caused by germs which can infect a building's air conditioning system.<p>
<p>Radiant heating provides a variety of special advantages over forced air heating systems. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They don't have to worry about duct leaks, which are responsible for output losses of as much as 30% in other heating unit types. Transferring heat through strong items will also cause it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home heated up by a radiant system will heat up faster, and stay warm with less energy invested. These are just a few of the numerous benefits that a radiant heat system can offer you.<p>

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 major elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
