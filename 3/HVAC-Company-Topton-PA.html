<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>What to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Topton PA</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a fairly simple to determine surrogate for indoor toxins released by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside your home might trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioner and heat pump should be without all obstructions and debris. Blockages can obstruct the flow of condensed water and cause wetness build-up within the system. Excess wetness can cause issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, uneven temperature level regulation, bacteria, and compromised air quality. An expert maintenance technician will clean the condensate and flush drain to ensure all excess moisture flows away from the system.<p>

<h3>Heating Duct in Topton PA</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and fixed extremely rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
