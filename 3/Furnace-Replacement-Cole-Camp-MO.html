<p>Enhance your services, earn more services revenue, and provide a fantastic consumer experience. To make sure the system you pick is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation estimate to determine the exact type of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we don't simply change it with the exact same size system you currently have. These estimations think about things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is important so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your house still heats to the right temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel extremely hot. If your home is not heating up, just be worried. However, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should employ a professional to examine and repair the unit.<p>
