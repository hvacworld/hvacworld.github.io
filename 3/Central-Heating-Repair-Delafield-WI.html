Gas furnace not blowing hot air? Just as with switches, somebody might have turned off a gas valve and then forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a deal with that's perpendicular to the gas pipeline, turn it so it's parallel. Gas furnace repair is depends on how old your furnace is. If you have an old furnace or boiler, you might have a pilot burner. Get rid of the front panel and the burner cover and check to make certain it's lit.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump work on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.
