<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Service in Ravensdale</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The first ac system and refrigerators utilized flammable or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
