<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Due to the fact that it simply takes more electricity to run a larger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
