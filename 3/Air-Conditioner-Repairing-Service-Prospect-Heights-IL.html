<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Prospect Heights IL</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
