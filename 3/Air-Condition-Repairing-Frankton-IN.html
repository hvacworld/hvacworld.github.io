<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Frankton IN?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
