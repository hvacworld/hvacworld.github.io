<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure reality that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as essential as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will typically build up in ductwork, restricting air flow.

By contrast, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can generally be performed in simply a few minutes, typically with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
