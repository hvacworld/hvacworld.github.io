<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Ossining NY - The Benefits</h3>
<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My other half said that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have fulfilled in a very long time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we desire to have alternatives to ACME heating.

<h3>AC Unit Repair in Ossining NY</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years earlier and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
