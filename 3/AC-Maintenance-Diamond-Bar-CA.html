<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>I have had the satisfaction of working with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for practically ten years and during that time, they have constantly provided excellent service.

<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
