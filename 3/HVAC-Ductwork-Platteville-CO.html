<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in location. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one reaction mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repetitive usage of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early deterioration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  a really advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
