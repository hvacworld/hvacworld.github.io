<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio.

As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>Integrity Energy fasted to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heaters were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced two heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new heaters can heat the house.

<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, because the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
