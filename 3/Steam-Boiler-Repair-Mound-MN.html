<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw.
