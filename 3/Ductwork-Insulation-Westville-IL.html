<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
