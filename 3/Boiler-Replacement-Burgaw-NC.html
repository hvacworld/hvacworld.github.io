<h3>Appropriate Things To Consider In Your Burgaw NC Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>

These systems can achieve a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling result. Many ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0.
