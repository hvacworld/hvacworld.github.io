<p>Today, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold might be residing in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar.

<p>In any case, Litan estimates that Target could be facing losses of approximately $420 million as an outcome of this breach, consisting of repayment related to banks recovering the expenses of reissuing millions of cards; fines from the card brands for PCI non-compliance; and direct Target customer care costs, consisting of legal fees and credit monitoring for 10s of millions of consumers affected by the breach.<p>
<p>Whatever heating system you install, it's vital that it's sized correctly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should.
