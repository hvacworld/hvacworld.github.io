<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
