<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
