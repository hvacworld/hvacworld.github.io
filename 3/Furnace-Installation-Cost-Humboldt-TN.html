<p>Iâ $ m truly fussy with my things. I like my devices and home appliances original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs. So buying this air conditioning unit to replace my old one was somewhat of a challenging reality. You canâ $ t trust the commercial nowadays. Am thankful I got this though since it has restored my faith in good production. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this brand-new Carrier I got given that I bought it 7 months earlier. Itâ $ s just perfect.<p>
