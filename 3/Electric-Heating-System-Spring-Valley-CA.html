<p>Are you adding a new space onto your home? Possibly you have a space with distinct heating and cooling obstacles, such as spaces that constantly seem to be too cold or too hot. That's where ductless Air conditioners can be found in! Likewise referred to as mini splits" or split level ACs," ductless Air conditioners can be set up in your house without all the pesky ductwork that includes standard HVAC systems.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
