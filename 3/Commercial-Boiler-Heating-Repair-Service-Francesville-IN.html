<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Francesville IN</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
