<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
