Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
