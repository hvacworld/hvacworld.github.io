<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ issue. Your company must check measurements of temperature, air and humidity circulation. In addition, examination and screening of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to ensure it is working according to specs for developing usage and occupancy) need to be carried out. A structure walk-through to look for odors and try to find water damage, leakages, dirt or pest droppings might be handy. Leakages require to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofings and in boiler pans can become infected with bacteria or fungis and require to be eliminated, also. In some scenarios, particular screening for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of structure occupancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be checked every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
