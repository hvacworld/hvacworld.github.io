<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
