<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
