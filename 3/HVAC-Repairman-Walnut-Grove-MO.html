<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

You will also enjoy a much more flexible system in terms of installation and cost. And since each indoor system has its own thermostat, you can bid farewell to thermostat warfare when one person would prefer it a little warmer in a different room.<p>
