<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.  Secondly like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the system has been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
