<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very pleased that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to test the ac system prior to you buy.

Due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
