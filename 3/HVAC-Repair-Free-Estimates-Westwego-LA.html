<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.

<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we recommend using our insulation boards. When utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash.
