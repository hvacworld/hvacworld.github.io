<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2.

<p>The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends upon several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts.
