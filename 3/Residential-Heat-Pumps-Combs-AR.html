<p>Particular instant results resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often difficult to figure out if the signs are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is necessary to take note of the time and place the symptoms take place. If the symptoms fade or disappear when an individual is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort needs to be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts might be made worse by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions prevalent in the home.<p>
<p>Picking the best size air conditioning system is an important part of the HVAC purchasing process and one that you'll need an HVAC expert to assist you with. Here's why buying the best size air conditioning system matters: if you purchase an HVAC system that's too big, you'll wind up wasting money and energy. And if it's too small, you will not get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfortable.<p>

Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you've offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
