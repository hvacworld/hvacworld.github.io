<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product in time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
