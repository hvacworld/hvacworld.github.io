<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
