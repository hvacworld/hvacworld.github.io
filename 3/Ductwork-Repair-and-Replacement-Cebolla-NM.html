<p>The heatpump gained popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can draw out heat from different sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Heat pumps move heat from outside the structure into the air within. At first, heat pump HVAC systems were just utilized in moderate environments, but with improvements in low temperature level operation and decreased loads due to more efficient houses, they are increasing in appeal in cooler climates.<p>
<p>Similar to many home improvement projects, the cost of a full central heating unit can differ commonly based upon the size of the home. Most heating systems will last in between 15 and twenty years. In choosing a furnace, property owners must consider heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the house. A small house, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and shut down for too long, leading to irregular temperature levels.<p>
