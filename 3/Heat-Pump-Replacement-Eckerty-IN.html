<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Secondly like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the system has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
