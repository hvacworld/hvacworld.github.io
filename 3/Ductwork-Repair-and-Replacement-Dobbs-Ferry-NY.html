<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings.

<p>They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They met my needs entirely by supplying a professional quote with options, without pressing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early.
