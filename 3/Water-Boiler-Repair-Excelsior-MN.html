<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Excelsior MN</h3>
<p>Sean was very handy. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler generally occur. In many cases, the belt is incorrectly aligned or used and requires replacement. Follow the guidelines above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
