Ac system help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in extremely damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning system is extra-large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your house.
