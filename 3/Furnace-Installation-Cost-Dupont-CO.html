<p>Professional heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail. HVAC experts recommend following this basic rule when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can also exacerbate indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system may be polluted (because of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for instance), and the system may spread these pollutants throughout the house. Second, the HVAC duct circulation system can spread toxins from one part of the house to another. Regular maintenance and duct sealing can help lessen these problems.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
