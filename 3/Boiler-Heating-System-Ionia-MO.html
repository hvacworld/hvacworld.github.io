<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to keep an eye out for is the dust that gathers throughout summertimes.

If your furnace is in an extremely poor condition, perhaps it is time to start considering purchasing a new one.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
