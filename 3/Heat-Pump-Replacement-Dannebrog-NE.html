<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, however, there will constantly be the odd issue that periodically shows up. It is very essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible when you do notice your furnace acting oddly.

<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heater in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
