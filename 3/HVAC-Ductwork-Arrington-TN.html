<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The probability of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends upon a number of elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends upon private level of sensitivity, which differs significantly from individual to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heatpump operate on electrical energy and work like ac system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the see. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out.

I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them again.<p>
