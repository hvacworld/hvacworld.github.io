<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are quickly breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat irritant could cause an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>
