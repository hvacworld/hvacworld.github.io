<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>All The Time Cooling is as guaranteed: offered immediately to offer exceptional service. Ilan Cohavi, the owner, works nicely and efficiently to provide a completed task in record time. He installed 3 Nest Learning Thermostats in my home. His knowledge of the item was outstanding. His craftsmanship was excellent and he didn't leave a mess. The perk: he is a very pleasant individual to deal with, and is very eager to complete the work according to the specifications of his client. I would highly advise him for all your HVAC needs.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a circulation system. Metal pipes are hardly ever used due to long-term corrosive issues. Essentially all hydronic radiant floor heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly flexible, won't rust and is available in long lengths, which allow PEX pipeline to be woven with minimal or no joints.<p>
