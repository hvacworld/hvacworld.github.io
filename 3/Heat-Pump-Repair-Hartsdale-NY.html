<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the increase it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can generally conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille.

In the summertime, the procedure reverses, thereby cooling a house by getting rid of heat. Underground temperature remains consistent no matter the environment, so geothermal systems offer constant and reputable cooling and heating.<p>
