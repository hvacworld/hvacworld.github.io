Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
