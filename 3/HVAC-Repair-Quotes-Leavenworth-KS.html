<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was sort of weird being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to use. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we fixed issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
