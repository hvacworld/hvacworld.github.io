<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in South San Francisco CA</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various home effectiveness upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's items and services was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the required electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
