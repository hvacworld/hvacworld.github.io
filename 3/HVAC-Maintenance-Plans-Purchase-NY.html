Building-Related Disease (BRI) refers to less frequent (but typically more serious) cases of people becoming ill after remaining in a specific building at a specific time.

Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago stay operable, due to the fact that the lack of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to wear and tear.

<p>A geothermal heater does not generate its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, gas, or coal. Instead, it absorbs heat from within the earth. In addition, a geothermal heating and cooling system utilizes significantly less electrical power compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heater an attractive solution to cut your carbon footprint, offering a favorable impact on the environment.<p>
<p>EPA's Total Exposure Assessment Approach (GROUP) studies found levels of about a dozen common organic toxins to be 2 to 5 times greater inside houses than outside, no matter whether the houses were found in extremely commercial or rural locations.

<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by most public water products, it has been discovered in well water. If you have actually checked the air in your home and discovered a radon problem, and you have a well, contact a laboratory licensed to measure radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon problems in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot next to the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides heat from the floor up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
