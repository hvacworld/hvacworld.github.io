<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
