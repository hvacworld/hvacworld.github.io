<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractors in Spring Lake</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
