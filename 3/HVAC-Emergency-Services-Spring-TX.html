<p>All Points Heating offers home air conditioning, a/c installation, air conditioner maintenance that provide dependable, proven performance at high effectiveness. Combustion products from auto exhaust, heating systems, water heaters, space heaters, aromatic candle lights, oil lamps, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not appropriately vented can generate carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.

When ventilation is not enough to account for a boost in the number of workers in the area, stale air might likewise be an issue.<p>
<p>There are some more serious dangers for HVAC workers that could be possibly fatal. They can be exposed to Carbon Monoxide which can be harmful. As HVAC specialists frequently enter contact with electrical wiring, they run the risk of being electrocuted. They can also suffer other kinds of burns and abrasions to the skin.
