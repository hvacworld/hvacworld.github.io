<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work.

<p>Remember, too, that you may want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and performance if you currently have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the incredibly hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
