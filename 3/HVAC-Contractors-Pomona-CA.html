<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a referral later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine.

To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires handled by professionals, see Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
