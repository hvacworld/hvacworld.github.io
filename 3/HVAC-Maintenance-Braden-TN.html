If the compressor starts but the fan does not, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover.

<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, frequently referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floorings, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
