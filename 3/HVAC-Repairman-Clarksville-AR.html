<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can pay for, numerous Seattleites need to find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the truth of a terrible, harsh summer.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
