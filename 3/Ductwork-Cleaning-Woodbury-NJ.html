<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept clean due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
