<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat.
