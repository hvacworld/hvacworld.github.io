<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Many common structure products used before 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Generally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimal since the fibers can be spread into the air during the removal procedure. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is typically recommended instead.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can end up being clogged with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can generally be performed in just a few minutes, often without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
