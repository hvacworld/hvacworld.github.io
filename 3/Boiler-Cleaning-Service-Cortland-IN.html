Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
