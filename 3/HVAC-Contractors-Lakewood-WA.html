Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

You can lower your expenses thanks to local rebates, special offers and tax credits To get the most accurate cost for your house, schedule a house assessment with your local dealer.<p>
