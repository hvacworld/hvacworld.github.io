It's not always about choosing the model with the highest SEER ranking, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can assist.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could grovel two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up just a few years ago.<p>
