These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter.

COP rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for each system of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the kind of heat.<p>
