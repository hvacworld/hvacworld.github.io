If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
