<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The possibility of instant responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon a number of aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether a person responds to a toxin depends on individual sensitivity, which differs enormously from individual to individual. Some people can become sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>There are many things to think about when attempting to determine how typically I must change my air conditioning filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a distinct DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about six months of close observation to see how typically your a/c filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right decision on how often your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with just one a/c filter require replacing regularly.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
