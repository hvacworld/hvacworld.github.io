<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to outside or commercial settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private spaces.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heatpump run on electrical energy and work like air conditioning unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating unit (like an area heating system) with the very same quantity of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
