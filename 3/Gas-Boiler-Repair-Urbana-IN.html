<p>Many house owners in Lancaster County are switching their house heating and Furnace systems from oil to gas, which typically reveals a significant cost savings. Our technicians are experienced at setting up replacement heating unit in existing homes, including running brand-new duct work and air returns.

<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy effective techniques of heating or cooling a house. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be warmed in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found just a few feet below ground. In the summer season, the procedure reverses, therefore cooling a home by getting rid of heat. Underground temperature level remains consistent no matter the environment, so geothermal systems provide trusted and consistent cooling and heating.<p>
<p>As with most home improvement tasks, the cost of a complete central heater can vary widely based on the size of the house. The majority of furnaces will last in between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, homeowner must think about heat output and performance. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace need to be matched to the size of the house. A small house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and turn off for too long, leading to irregular temperature levels.<p>

<p>While pollutant levels from individual sources may not present a significant health risk by themselves, many homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a major risk from the cumulative effects of these sources.

<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
