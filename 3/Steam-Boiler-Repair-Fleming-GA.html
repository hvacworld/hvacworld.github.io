<p>Measurement treatments are being developed and shown to evaluate building ventilation and indoor pollutant concentrations. These procedures range from advanced tracer gas techniques used primarily in developing research study efforts to less involved procedures that can be employed by building operators.

<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single household houses, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to big industrial and office buildings such as healthcare facilities and high-rise buildings, cars such as automobiles, trains, aircrafts, submarines and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are controlled with regard to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that best temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job.

So, make sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which normally includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
