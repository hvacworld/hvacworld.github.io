<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>
