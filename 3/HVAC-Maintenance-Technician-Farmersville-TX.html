<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
