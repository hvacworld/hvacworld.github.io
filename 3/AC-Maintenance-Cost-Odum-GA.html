Just as with switches, somebody may have turned off a gas valve and after that forgotten to turn it back on.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>Passive Ventilation in Odum GA</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the see. They advised replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was extremely happy they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>
