<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
