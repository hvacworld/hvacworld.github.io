<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Ensure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years earlier and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
