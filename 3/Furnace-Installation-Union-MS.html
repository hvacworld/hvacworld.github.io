<p>Certain immediate results are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often difficult to determine if the symptoms are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is important to focus on the time and location the signs take place. If the symptoms fade or disappear when an individual is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort needs to be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects might be made worse by an inadequate supply of outside air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions widespread in the house.<p>
<p>Choosing the best size a/c is an essential part of the HVAC buying procedure and one that you'll require an HVAC professional to help you with. Here's why purchasing the best size air conditioning system matters: if you purchase an HVAC system that's too huge, you'll end up losing cash and energy.

<p>EPA's Overall Direct exposure Evaluation Method (TEAM) studies discovered levels of about a dozen typical organic toxins to be 2 to 5 times greater inside homes than outside, despite whether the houses were found in highly commercial or rural locations.
