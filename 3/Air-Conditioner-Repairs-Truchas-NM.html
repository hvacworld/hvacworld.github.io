<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
