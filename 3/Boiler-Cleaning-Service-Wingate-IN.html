<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
