<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Max ND</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>Similar to homes, the most important factor influencing indoor air quality is the presence of pollutant sources.
