<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Appropriate ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German technology". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to create a corporate union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take steps to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-404a and r-410a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in vehicles, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.
