PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While room cooling provides optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
