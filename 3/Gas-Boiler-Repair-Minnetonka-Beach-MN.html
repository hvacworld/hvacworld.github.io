He showed the points of assessment and also suggested I have a UV light set up due to a little accumulation of mold collecting in the air handler, which he completely cleaned the outside and examined compressor coils as well as ensured the moisture discharge tube was clear by using a cleaning liquid and a store vacuum. He also removed the leaves that accumulated inside the interior of the compressor unit and recommended an option to prevent it from continuing, which will do.I got an in-depth e-mail report of the inspection laying out all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is an asset to Waychoff's and I highly suggest him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>
