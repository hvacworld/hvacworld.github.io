<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
