<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic.
