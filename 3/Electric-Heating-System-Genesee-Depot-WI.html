<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
