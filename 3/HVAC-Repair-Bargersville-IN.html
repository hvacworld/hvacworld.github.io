These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>For example, impurities may collect within the air diffusers and grills, presenting contaminants into the environment.
