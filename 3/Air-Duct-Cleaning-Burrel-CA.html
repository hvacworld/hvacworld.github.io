<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heating systems were not working. They appeared the next day and changed 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new heaters can heat your home.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
