<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Paradise UT</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
