In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>A/c manufacturers typically make rugged, high quality products. If your ac system stops working, start by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers.

Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the wetness problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the location utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>
