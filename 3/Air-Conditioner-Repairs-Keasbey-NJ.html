<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send exhaust exterior.

Wood-burning stoves can also produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
