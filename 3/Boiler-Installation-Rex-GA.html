<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in delay functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>The people operating at Target aren't lazy or dumb and in this organisation all it takes is one tiny fracture in your defenses and someone will discover it and pry you broad open, often in just a couple of days. That crack can be a relatively innocuous error by a colleague and even you. This is no longer the realm of the only hacker but rather around the world, the mob and they are far better funded and staffed than any of us might ever be.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might observe moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
