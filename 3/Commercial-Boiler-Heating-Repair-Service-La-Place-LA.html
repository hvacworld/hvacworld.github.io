<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and treat-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
