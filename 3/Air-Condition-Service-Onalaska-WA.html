<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the right temperature level. Heaters that kick on frequently may be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively.
