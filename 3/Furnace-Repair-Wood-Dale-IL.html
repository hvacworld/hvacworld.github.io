<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Location the solar tank near the conventional hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing. Set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed.<p>

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Individuals who are allergic to these contaminants must utilize allergen-proof mattress encasements, wash bedding in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and avoid space home furnishings that build up dust, specifically if they can not be cleaned in hot water. Allergic people need to also leave the house while it is being vacuumed due to the fact that vacuuming can in fact increase airborne levels of mite allergens and other biological impurities. Utilizing central vacuum systems that are vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high efficiency filters might likewise be of aid.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your vehicle. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high use months, examine the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
