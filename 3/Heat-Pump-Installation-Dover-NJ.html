<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Vital Business in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are ranked 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which may be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can imply considerable cost savings in yearly heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipelines are seldom used due to long-term corrosive issues. Practically all hydronic glowing flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is extremely flexible, will not rust and comes in long lengths, which allow PEX pipeline to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
