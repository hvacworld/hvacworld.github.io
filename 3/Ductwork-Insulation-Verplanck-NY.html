<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for years.

<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Verplanck NY</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out.
