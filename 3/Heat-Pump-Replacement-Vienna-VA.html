<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Firstly, The after hours responding to service representative, John, was professional and very courteous. Secondly, Gracion W is a timely, educated technician. He was at my home within the time he gave me, fixed the issue while discussing the problem then remained numerous minutes to ensure it was working appropriately. The concern was repaired in a matter of time that I've never seen before while being a homeowner for ten years.
