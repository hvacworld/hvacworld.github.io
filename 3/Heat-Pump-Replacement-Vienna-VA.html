The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
