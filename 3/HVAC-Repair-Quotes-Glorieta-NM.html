These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating unit, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles.

In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
