<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I've got a bud who works in security for a company that produces much of the plastic used around the world, including EMV. He's said numerous times that the special code feature is optional and many, lots of sellers don't utilize it because it decreases transactions even more due to the back-and-forth interactions needed.

<p>Numerous indoor air contaminants originate from the kitchen area. Gas stoves release damaging contaminants, including carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide.

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.
