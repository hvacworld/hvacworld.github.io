<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " number one ecological risk to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust.
