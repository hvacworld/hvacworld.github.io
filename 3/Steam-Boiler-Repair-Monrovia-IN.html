<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company utilized 98% of the existing product bought with your house. This company presented a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes. During the evaluation on a really cold day they killed the furnace declaring health threat factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a new property owner I have discovered how to determine the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that an a/c unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both should be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
