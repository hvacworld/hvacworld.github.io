<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had actually spotted the difficulty area in examining the costs. He dealt with the issue in one day, had actually adjusted the bill to what I considered reasonable before he called back, knew what may have caused the problem and had a strategy to insure that it would not take place once again. I have considered All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have used them. This experience confirms that.<p>

When they are handled in a way that produces dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled, these items provide a danger just. When asbestos-containing products are harmed or interrupted by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can become airborne if correct controls are not in location.
