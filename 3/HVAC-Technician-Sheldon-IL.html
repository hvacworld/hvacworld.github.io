<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
