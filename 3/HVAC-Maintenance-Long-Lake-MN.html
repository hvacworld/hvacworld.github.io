<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power ought to not go beyond the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capability by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, because the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not easy, because it considers not just the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
