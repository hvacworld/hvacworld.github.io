<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
