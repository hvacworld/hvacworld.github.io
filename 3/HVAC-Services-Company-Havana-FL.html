<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
