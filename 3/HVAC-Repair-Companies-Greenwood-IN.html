<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in damp air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, preventing mold growth and pollution. Of course, too-dry air can likewise aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health.

<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they detected the problem and repaired very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working, integrity Energy was quick to respond. They showed up the next day and replaced two furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the brand-new heaters can heat your house. Honestly, our home heating system is made complex, Rob and his team repaired the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
<p>Just a professional can accurately identify why your furnace isn't starting. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems weird or you lose self-confidence, it's time to call an expert. Likewise, if the procedure does not work, something else is incorrect and you need a technician to take a look at the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you find you need to do it regularly, it's probably time for a professional viewpoint.<p>
