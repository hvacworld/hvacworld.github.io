<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Glenview IL</h3>
<p>Central air systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
