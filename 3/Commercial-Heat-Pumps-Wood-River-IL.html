What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall.

We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
