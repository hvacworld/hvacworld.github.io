<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
