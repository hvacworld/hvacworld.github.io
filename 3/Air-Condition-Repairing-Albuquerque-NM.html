<p>A third method to choose whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, try to find signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can indicate your home might not have enough ventilation include wetness condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being moldy.
