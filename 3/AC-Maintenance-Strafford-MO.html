<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
