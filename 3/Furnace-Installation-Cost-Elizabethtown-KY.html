<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Elizabethtown KY</h3>

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
