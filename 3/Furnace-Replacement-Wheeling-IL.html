<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
