<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
