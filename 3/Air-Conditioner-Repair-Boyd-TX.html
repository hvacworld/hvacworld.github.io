This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
