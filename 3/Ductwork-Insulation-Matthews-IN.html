Have been through a couple of companies for many years and Wachoff's is certainly the best I have actually had the chance to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been excellent.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside system as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
