<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature level of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
