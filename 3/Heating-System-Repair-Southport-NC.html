<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and treat-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>As discussed above, activating your brand-new under tile floor heating unit too soon, before the mortar has actually cured, can cause the grout to split or to not adhere effectively, and may void the warranty of your mortar product. In some testing, even the tile split when the system was run before the compound had actually treated. If you do not follow their guidelines, and mortar manufacturers may refuse warranty coverage.<p>
