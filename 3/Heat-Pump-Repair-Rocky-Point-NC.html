If several registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers.

Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
