<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
