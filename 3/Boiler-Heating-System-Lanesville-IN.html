<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
