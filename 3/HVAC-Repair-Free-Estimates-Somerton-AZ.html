<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.

<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home won't heat up.

A filthy filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
