<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Ault CO</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
