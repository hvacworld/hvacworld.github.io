<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
