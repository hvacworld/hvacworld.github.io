<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
