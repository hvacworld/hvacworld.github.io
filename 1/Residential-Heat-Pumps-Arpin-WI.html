<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, during new construction (houses normally use between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. Nevertheless, new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the right conditions.<p>
