<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of furnaces have numerous control boards. The biggest, or only one in some furnaces, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control board need to be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t properly identified, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when installed.
