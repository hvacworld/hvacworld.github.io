<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
