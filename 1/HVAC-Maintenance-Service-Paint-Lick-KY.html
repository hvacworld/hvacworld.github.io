This company introduced a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the inspection on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health hazard factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new property owner I have actually found out how to identify the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
