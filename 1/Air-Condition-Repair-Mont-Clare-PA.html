These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
