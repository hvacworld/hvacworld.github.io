<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
