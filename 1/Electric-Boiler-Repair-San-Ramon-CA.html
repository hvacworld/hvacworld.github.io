<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

When radon becomes caught in buildings and concentrations develop inside, exposure to radon ends up being an issue.<p>
