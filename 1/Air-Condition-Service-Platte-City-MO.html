Additional weatherization procedures must not be carried out up until these issues have actually been fixed.<p>
<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals used in the construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances).

Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to eliminate products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can likewise develop particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
