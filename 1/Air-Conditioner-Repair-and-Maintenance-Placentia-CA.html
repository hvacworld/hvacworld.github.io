<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have several control boards. The largest, or only one in some furnaces, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control board should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t properly identified, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
