<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
