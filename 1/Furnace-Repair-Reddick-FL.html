<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heating unit, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as vital as a regular oil change in your car. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter once every 3 months. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
