<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
