In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
