<p>The very first air conditioning unit and refrigerators employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
