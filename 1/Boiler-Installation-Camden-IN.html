The collectors, piping and tank should be checked for leakages, the system must be flushed periodically to remove tank and gathered impurities (scaling in tough water areas). The systems must be inspected at least two times annually for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be washed periodically to get rid of dust gathered in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>

These aspects include bad ventilation (lack of outside air), problems managing temperature, high or low humidity, current renovation, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air entering into the structure. In some cases, particular contaminants like dust from building or remodelling, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals launched as a gas in time) may cause poor IAQ.<p>
