<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
