<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Repair in Lexington SC</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
