<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements set up in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
