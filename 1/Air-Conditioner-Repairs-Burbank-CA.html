<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past.
