<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it took to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion objective.
