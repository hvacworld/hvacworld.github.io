<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My eldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, flooring, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days might become a source for mold development and ought to be discarded. Often there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the moisture problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
