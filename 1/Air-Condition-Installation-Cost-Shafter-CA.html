<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work.

He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
