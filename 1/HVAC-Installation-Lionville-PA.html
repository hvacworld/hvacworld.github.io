<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. Simply including refrigerant is not a service if it leaks. An experienced technician must fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and effectiveness of your air conditioning system is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's requirements, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can likewise be harmful to the environment.<p>
