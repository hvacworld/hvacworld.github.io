<h3>Working of an HVAC System in Arvin CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We picked getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenses. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
