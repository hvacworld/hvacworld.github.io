Let the unit cool down for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>

The noise level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
