Let the unit cool down for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>

<p>My oldest boy always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didn√¢ $ t disperse air like it did before. We√¢ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didn√¢ $ t actually consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is it√¢ and low $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
