<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system.
