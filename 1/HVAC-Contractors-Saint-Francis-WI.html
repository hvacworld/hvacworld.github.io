<p>Dometic's commercial grade rooftop a/c unit are performance-tested to get rid of harsh or uncommon roadway and weather conditions. Numerous basic units break down after simply four hours of severe vibration screening, while the Brisk II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel top plate supplies enduring strength while long copper lines minimize vibration and, therefore, sound too. While being one of the toughest a/c unit around, its 410A refrigerant is kinder to the environment. Robust, light-weight and capable of performing in any environment! It will not let you down.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Normally the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
