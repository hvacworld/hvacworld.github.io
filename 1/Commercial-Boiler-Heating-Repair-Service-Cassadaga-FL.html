<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heatpump work on electrical power and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like a space heating system) with the very same quantity of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Since these activities produce big amounts of lead dust, individuals have actually been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint. Consult your state health or real estate department for tips on which personal labs or public companies might be able to help test your home for lead in paint. House test kits can not spot percentages of lead under some conditions. Hire an individual with special training for fixing lead paint issues to get rid of lead-based paint. Residents, especially children and pregnant ladies, need to leave the structure until all work is completed and clean-up is done.<p>
<p>1. Central Air Conditioning Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a mild climate, where the temperature level doesn't get too low or too high. In other words, they are ideal for our Seattle climate! They are extremely efficient, vanquishing most other types of heating unit in performance. The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. However, a geothermal installation normally costs tens of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which normally suggests it fails in terms of return on investment.<p>
