<p>I am a real estate investor, I require to replace two heating systems in a 8000square foot home. Some sources, such as developing materials, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can launch toxins basically continually. Other sources, associated to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, remodeling or doing hobblies release contaminants periodically. Unvented or malfunctioning home appliances or poorly utilized products can launch higher and often dangerous levels of pollutants indoors.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
