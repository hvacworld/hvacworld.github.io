<p>Expert heating unit installations. For any contractor, HVAC or otherwise, these firms offer opportunities they can't achieve on their own. A lot of owners stick with the larger firms after acquisition. In some cases, the acquisition offers a way for the seller to retire and ensure staff members are taken care of.

Reedy prefers the owners stay on and reinvest a portion of their equity from the sale back into the company, although this isn't a requirement.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>
