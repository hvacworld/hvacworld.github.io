<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Moorpark CA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system".

When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
