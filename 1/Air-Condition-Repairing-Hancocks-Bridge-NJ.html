<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
