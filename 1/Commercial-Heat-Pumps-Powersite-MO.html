Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them up until they have been correctly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
