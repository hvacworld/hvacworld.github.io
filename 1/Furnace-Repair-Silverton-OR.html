<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from products or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, since the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally just available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best alternative for house owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
