<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance sees each year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and normally some other benefits. Some companies provide priority appointments to their maintenance plan members.<p>
