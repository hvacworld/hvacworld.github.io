<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the tools or skills necessary to inspect refrigerant levels.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still required to have a professional technician examine the system regularly.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your home might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, search for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can show your home might not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, foul-smelling or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To find smells in your home, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether smells are visible.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
