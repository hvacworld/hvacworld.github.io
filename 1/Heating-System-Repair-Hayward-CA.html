<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
