<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The function of the majority of building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing safety at reasonable energy costs.

Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%.

The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
