<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
