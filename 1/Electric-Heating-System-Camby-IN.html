<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
