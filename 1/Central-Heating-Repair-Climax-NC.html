Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air conditioning unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning system are more energy effective than designs made even 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to replace or upgrade your system if it's 5 years old or older. The very best central air conditioning conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while delivering the exact same amount of cooling.<p>

<p>Buildings are developed or meant to respond actively to a few of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems.
