<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
