<p>Nick B. offered extraordinary, individualized, mindful, and quality service. His interaction style is friendly, engaging and reliable. He clearly and completely discussed all issues and repairs in a way that made me positive in his ability to resolve my repair problems. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a required part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my other half and I would not need to sustain another night without heat, during one of the coldest winter seasons in current memory. He also responded to my call immediately the next morning, and coached me through a temporary repair to an issue that couldn't be fixed on the very first see due to not available parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and capability to deliver constant, quality service.<p>
