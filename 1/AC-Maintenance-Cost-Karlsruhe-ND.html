<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While space a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>

New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
