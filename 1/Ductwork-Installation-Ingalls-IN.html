PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two different units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While space a/c provides maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
