<h3>Benefits of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Lodi WI</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit need relatively little attention. But, as with any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is necessary to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of standard hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank must be checked for leaks, the system ought to be flushed regularly to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water areas). The systems should be checked a minimum of two times per year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed periodically to remove dust gathered in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
