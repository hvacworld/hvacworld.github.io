<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air.
