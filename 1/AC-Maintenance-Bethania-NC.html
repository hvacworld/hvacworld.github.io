<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, because some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
