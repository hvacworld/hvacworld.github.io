<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, occasionally connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also regulating the temperature of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Many well and city water does not typically contain lead. Water typically gets lead inside the home from family pipes that is made with lead products. The only way to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to learn how to get the water evaluated. Send for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
