<p>The exhaust outlets allow all unsafe gases to escape your property so there's no risky buildup of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. They can lead to a hazardous build-up and compromise your safety if the exhaust outlets are blocked. The technician will assess all of these aspects of your system and check the chimney flue and vent stack too. They will search for indications of deterioration, leakages, and back draft and repair the issue during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Strategy on investing numerous thousand dollars for the total system if you are thinking about setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house.
