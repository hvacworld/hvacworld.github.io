<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
