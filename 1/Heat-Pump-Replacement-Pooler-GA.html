<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big retailer who asked not to be named since he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps track of energy usage and temperatures in shops to save money on costs (especially at night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the shops vary outside of an acceptable variety that could prevent customers from shopping at the shop.<p>
