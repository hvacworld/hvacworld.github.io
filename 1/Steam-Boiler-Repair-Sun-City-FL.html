<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the go to. They advised replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective.
