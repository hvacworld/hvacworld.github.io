<p>All Points Heating uses home cooling, a/c installation, air conditioning unit maintenance that deliver reliable, tested performance at high performance. Combustion items from car exhaust, heating systems, hot water heater, area heaters, fragrant candles, oil lights, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not correctly vented can create carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.
