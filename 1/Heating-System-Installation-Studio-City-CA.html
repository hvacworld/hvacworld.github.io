<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
