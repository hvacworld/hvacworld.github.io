<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the see. They advised changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective.

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing product purchased with your house. This company presented a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes.

As a brand-new resident I have discovered how to recognize the truthful HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same.

Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly harden and cure-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
