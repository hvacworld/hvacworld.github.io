<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
