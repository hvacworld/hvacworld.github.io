<p>Buildings are developed or planned to respond actively to a few of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sterilize, and preserve surfaces to improve their durability, performance, or look. In other cases, such changes subtly and even considerably change structures in ways that might be essential to their own integrity or their impact on structure occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We might discover it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, a few of the approaches utilized by scientists studying environments, in order to get an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
