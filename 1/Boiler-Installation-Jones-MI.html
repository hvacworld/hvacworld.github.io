Appropriate ventilation and elimination of the sources of these impurities are important in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location.
