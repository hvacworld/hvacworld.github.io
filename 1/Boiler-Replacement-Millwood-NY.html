<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.
