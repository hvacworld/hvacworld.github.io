<p>While toxin levels from private sources might not pose a considerable health risk by themselves, most homes have more than one source that adds to indoor air contamination. There can be a major danger from the cumulative results of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that many people can take both to reduce the danger from existing sources and to avoid brand-new problems from happening. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to do something about it that can minimize the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you find you have to do it frequently, it's most likely time for an expert viewpoint.<p>
