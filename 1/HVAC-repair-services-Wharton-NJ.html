<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
