<p>Structures are designed or meant to react actively to some of these changes around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and maintain surface areas to boost their look, durability, or efficiency. In other cases, such changes discreetly and even significantly change structures in manner ins which may be necessary to their own integrity or their influence on building residents through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time.

<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may see undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse.
