<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those measurements on hand when looking for an air conditioning system to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
