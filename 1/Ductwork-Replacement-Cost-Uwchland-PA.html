<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
