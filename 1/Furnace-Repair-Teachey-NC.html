<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor in Teachey NC</h3>

<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the professionals believed they simply didn't seem best and they could not leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise regulating the temperature level of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches.

<p>They were great! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for. They met my requirements totally by supplying an expert quote with options, without pushing extra items. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The also immediately followed up with the required inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
