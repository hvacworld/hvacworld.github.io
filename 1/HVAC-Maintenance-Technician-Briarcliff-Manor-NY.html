<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
