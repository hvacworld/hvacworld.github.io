<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
