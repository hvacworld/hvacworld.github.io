<h3>HVAC Supply in Tobaccoville NC</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
