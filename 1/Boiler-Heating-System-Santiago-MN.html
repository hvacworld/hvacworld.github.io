<p>These guys have been excellent. At a realtor, I in some cases need contractors to offer me an opinion for what deal with a home may cost. Recently I required to contact these guys twice. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my client probably wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty.

<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly solidify and treat-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
