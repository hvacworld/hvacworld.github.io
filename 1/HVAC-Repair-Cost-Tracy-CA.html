Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
