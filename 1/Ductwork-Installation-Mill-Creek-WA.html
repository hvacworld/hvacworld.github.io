<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
