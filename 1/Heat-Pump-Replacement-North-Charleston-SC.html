<h3>Commercial HVAC in North Charleston SC</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
