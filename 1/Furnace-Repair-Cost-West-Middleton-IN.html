<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ may see musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
