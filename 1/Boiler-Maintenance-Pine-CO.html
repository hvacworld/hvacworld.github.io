<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. However, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item.
