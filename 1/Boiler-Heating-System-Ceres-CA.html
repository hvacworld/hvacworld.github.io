<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
