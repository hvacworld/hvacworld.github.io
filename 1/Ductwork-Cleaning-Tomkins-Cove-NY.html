<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outdoors air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.<p>
