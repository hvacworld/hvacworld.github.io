<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally triggered by the lack of adequate ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the main issue in over half the workplace indoor air examinations it has actually carried out. Investigations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the exact same to be real. These examinations revealed that appropriate ventilation is essential in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements.
