<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more residents there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outdoors air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
