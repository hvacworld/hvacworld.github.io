<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time.

Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
