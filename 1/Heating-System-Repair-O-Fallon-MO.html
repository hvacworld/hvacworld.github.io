<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC.
