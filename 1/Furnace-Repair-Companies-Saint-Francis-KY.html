<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, since it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever.
