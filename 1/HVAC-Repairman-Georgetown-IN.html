Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J calculation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or system cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone. Just like measuring the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, determining the appropriate size of unit for your house likewise depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
