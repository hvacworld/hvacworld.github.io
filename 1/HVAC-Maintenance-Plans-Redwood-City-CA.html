<p>As kept in mind, improper temperature level and humidity levels, and too much or too little air flow may also contribute to employee health grievances. Temperature level levels must range from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air blood circulation must be prevented. Maintenance of appropriate temperatures and humidity levels and proper air circulation will help to decrease the occurrence of upper breathing symptoms, and, potentially, skin rashes.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, considering that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical standards remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends on the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation. Geothermal heatpump generally need excavation to set up, which includes several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
