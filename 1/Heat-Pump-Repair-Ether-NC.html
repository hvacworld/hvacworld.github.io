<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leaks, merely adding refrigerant is not a solution. A trained technician ought to fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate quantity of refrigerant.

<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, considering that a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each space.
