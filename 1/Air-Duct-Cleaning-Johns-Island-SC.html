<p>Central air systems are determined in tons. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that best temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in pricey repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service strategy which usually includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Only a specialist can precisely diagnose why your furnace isn't starting. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems unusual or you lose self-confidence, it's time to call a professional. Likewise, if the process doesn't work, something else is incorrect and you require a technician to take a look at the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you need to do it frequently, it's probably time for a professional opinion.<p>
