<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Before you head out and buy an air conditioner, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning system?

Too big and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c unit and shorten its life. Too small and your air conditioner will not have the ability to cool your house properly. These are simply a few of the aspects that you require to take into consideration when looking for a brand-new AC system. Each option can and will significantly impact your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to overlook any of them.<p>
