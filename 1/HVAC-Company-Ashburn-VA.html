Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor.

For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by many people.<p>
