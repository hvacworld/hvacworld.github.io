<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service at Deland FL</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based just on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few reasonable ones received. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install assessment results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>HVAC Services Company in Deland FL</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they identified the issue and repaired very rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
