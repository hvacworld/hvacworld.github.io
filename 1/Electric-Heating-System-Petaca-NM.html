<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material over time.

Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
