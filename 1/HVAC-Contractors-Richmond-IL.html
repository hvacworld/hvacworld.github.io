Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
