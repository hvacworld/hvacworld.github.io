<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Black Hawk CO</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
