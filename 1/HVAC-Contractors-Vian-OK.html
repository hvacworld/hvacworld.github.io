<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
