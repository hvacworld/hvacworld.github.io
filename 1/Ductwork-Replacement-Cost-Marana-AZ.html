<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
