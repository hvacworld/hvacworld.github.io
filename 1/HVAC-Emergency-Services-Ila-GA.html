<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
