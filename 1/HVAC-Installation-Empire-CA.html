<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might go into nearby ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
