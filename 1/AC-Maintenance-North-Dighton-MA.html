<h3>Hot Water Heating System in North Dighton MA</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
