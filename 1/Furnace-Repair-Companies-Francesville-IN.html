<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your house still heats to the right temperature. The temperature level of the air produced by the heatpump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel really hot. Just be worried if your house is not heating up. However, if your system does not appear to be working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must call in a professional to examine and repair the unit.<p>
