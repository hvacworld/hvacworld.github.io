<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and difficulty in breathing in some people exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper.

When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
