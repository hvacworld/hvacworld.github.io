<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat.
