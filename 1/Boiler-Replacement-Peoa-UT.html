What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
