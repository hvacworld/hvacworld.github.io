<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature. Furnaces that kick on frequently may be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
