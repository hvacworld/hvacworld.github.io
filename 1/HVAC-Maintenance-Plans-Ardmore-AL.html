<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Ardmore AL</h3>
<p>Elements that can add to the development of biological pollutants are moist or damp structure materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a typical illness caused by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Different fungis and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are animals and household plants.<p>
