<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>

In the process, heat is taken in from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
