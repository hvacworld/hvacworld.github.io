<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
