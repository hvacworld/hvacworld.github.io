This is normally utilized in a third-floor or 2nd area and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put.

<p>When installing a wall sensor, think about the height at which they must be placed. Many frequently they are mounted at height-level or slightly lower, if people mainly stay seated in that particular location.
