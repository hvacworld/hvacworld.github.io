As a result your oil or natural gas furnace might run longer to supply the very same amount of heat. This will trigger your energy costs to increase. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies on a monthly basis could be utilized to help you spend for a brand-new, far more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating costs with heating costs from the previous years. It's time to replace your furnace if there is a substantial difference.<p>
