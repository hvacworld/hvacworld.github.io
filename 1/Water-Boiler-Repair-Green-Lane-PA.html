<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heat pump, everything requires to be replaced eventually. As equipment ages, it ends up being less effective. Central air systems and heatpump generally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last approximately twenty years. If your system is near, or past, its expected life-span, replacement may be the most affordable option.<p>
