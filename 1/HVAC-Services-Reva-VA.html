<h3>Boiler Maintenance at Reva VA - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in home building is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in floorings, roofing systems, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air assists and waters down indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>

Follow the guidelines above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
