The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

However, pick your contractor carefully, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed house owners.
