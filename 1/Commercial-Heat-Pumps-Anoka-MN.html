I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again.
