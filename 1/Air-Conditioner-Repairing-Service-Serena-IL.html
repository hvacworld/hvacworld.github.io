Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
