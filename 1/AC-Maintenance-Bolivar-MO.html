<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall.

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
