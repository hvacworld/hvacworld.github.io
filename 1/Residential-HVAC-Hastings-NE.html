<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roof, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for house owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those seeking to save money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying just a cooling system.
