<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Grace MS</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
