If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue.

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Ensure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
