<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't put the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow constraint will reduce the unit's performance. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. Make certain to have those measurements on hand when looking for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit easily into the window.
