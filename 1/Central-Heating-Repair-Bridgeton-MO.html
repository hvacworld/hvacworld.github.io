<p>Furnaces as they age run the risk of developing cracks in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide, if present, could leak into your house undetected. Indications of this might be frequent headaches, a burning sensation in nose or eyes, nausea, disorientation, flu-like symptoms.

<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works however your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
