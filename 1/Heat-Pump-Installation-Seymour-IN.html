<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Seymour IN</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We picked getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
