<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain harmful compounds (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores. The primary hazard of mold development, as it connects to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than the majority of allergenic properties is the capability of mold to set off episodes in persons that already have asthma, a severe breathing illness.<p>

<h3>Ductwork Insulation in Emmett ID</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
