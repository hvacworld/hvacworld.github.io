<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
