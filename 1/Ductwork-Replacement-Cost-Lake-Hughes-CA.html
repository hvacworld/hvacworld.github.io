If you're trying to find a new heating system for your home, you need to have a look at a few of the other options readily available before settling on a system that may not fit your needs best. Radiant heat, for example, may be a much better suitable for your requirements.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
