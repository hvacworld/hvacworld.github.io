If you're trying to find a new heating system for your home, you need to have a look at a few of the other options readily available before settling on a system that may not fit your needs best.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
