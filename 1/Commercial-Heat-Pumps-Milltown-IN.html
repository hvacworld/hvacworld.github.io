For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
