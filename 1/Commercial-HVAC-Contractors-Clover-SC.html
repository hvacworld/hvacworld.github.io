<p>Certain immediate effects resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often tough to determine if the symptoms are a result of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is important to focus on the time and location the symptoms occur. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is far from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort must be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some results might be intensified by an inadequate supply of outdoor air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions prevalent in the house.<p>
<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The primary indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, stored fuels and paint materials, and car emissions in connected garages. Actions that will minimize benzene exposure consist of eliminating smoking cigarettes within the home, attending to maximum ventilation throughout painting, and disposing of paint materials and special fuels that will not be utilized right away.<p>
<p>Many HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that permit homeowner to control the temperature and set it on a schedule. For example, you can set the thermostat to reduce the heat when you're not in house to conserve money on the energy expenses and guarantee the system isn't overburdened. A professional technician will inspect the thermostat during the yearly maintenance to guarantee the actual temperature level and the temperature level on the thermostat matches. The technician needs to examine the thermostat's efficiency or examine the entire HVAC system if there's a distinction in the temperature.<p>
