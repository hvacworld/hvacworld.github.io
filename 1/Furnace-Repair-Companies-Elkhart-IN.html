<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts decades, because it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up.

The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in.
