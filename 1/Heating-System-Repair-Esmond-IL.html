<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for house owners to think about. Many times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those aiming to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are usually only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best option for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
