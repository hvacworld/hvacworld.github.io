<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.
