<p>There are two main types of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating organisation. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are required to resist current, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
