<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were terrific! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my requirements entirely by offering an expert quote with options, without pressing extra products. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise quickly followed up with the needed inspections from the city.
