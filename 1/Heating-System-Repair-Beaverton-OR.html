<p>All houses need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage.

Furnaces that kick on regularly might be due to an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
