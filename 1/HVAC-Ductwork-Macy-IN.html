<p>We called Elite A/C on one of the hottest days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to evaluate situation & chose to choose them for the work.

Everybody we talked to from starting to end were very professional, courteous and the work was really efficiently done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally requested.

The also without delay followed up with the required inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
