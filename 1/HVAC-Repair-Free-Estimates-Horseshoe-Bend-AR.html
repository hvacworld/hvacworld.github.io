<p>There are 2 primary types of glowing flooring heating, or RFH as it's understood in the home heating service. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface.

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the skills or tools essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still required to have an expert technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
