<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
