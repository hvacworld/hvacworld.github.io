<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
