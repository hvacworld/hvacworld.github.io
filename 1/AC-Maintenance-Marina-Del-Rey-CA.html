<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the condenser, evaporator, and compressor are all located in one cabinet, which typically is put on a roofing system or on a concrete piece next to your home's foundation.

<h3>Furnace Repair in Marina Del Rey CA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
