<p>The homes and composition of the soil in a location can impact the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground. These must be taken into consideration before picking the best design of an underground cooling and heating system. Soil with favorable heat transfer properties needs less pipelines to achieve the wanted underground heating and cooling impact, while those with decreased thermal conductivity will require more pipelines.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might discover undesirable or musty odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
