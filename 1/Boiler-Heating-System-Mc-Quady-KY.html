<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The purpose of many structure ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and constructing security at reasonable energy costs. Load determining is referred to as the Manual J computation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square footage alone.

<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year.
