<p>If no impurity sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions.

<p>I am really satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
