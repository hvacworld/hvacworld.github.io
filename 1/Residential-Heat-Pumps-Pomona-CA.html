<p>I have been using them for years for my businesses, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is sincere, reliable, and affordable on cost. It's difficult to discover an honest AC guy and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>
