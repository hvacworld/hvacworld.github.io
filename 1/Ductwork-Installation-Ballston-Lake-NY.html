<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
