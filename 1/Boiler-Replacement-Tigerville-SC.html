<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Tigerville SC</h3>
<p>Area Ventilation. Exterior exhaust fans need to be set up in all restrooms and kitchen areas. These fans eliminate humidity and carbon monoxide. The most effective fans are quiet and durable. Use fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to make sure the fans run for an enough period of time. A great rule of thumb is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
