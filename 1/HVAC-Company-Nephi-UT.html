<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Nephi UT?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We selected getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
