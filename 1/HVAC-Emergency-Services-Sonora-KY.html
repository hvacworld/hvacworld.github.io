<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly may be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
