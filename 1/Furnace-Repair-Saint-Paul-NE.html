<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. If your a/c is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Just including refrigerant is not an option if it leakages. A qualified technician ought to repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant.

<h3>Furnace Repair in Saint Paul NE</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the go to. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the new part. I was extremely happy they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
