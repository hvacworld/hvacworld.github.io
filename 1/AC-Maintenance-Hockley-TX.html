<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
