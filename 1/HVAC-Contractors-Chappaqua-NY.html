<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively easy to determine surrogate for indoor toxins discharged by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside your home may cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly lowers direct exposure to contaminants during cooking. Improper change, frequently indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly if you acquire a new gas stove or variety. Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in usage, always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
