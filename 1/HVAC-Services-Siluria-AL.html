<h3>AC Unit Repair in Siluria AL</h3>

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult task that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps men working. When a sales man pertains to your home he exists to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and should not "need" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your requirements and you decide if you require it.<p>

<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Siluria AL Home</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
