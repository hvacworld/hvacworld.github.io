<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>
