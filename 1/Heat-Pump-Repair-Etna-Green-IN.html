<p>Professional heating unit installations. However, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals advise following this basic guideline when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>

So, make certain to choose based on how typically you will utilize your heating system, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year.
