As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the wetness issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
