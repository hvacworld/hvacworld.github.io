Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling result.
