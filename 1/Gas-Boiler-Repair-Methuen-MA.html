<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been shown to cause the health results pointed out. However, it is not necessarily true that the effects kept in mind take place at the pollutant concentration levels usually found in the home. Oftentimes, our understanding of the pollutants and their health impacts is too limited to determine the levels at which the listed effects could occur.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly intricate and structure occupants may be exposed to a variety of impurities (in the form of gases and particles) from workplace devices, cleaning items, building and construction activities, carpets and furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outside pollutants. Other factors such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise impact how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
