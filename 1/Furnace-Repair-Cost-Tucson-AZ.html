Because the energy used to heat your house is extracted directly from the ground, it protects the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or contaminants. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems similar to those utilized in fridges. While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical energy, they release far fewer greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in gathering information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
