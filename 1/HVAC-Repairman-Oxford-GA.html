<p>Instantaneous discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are available to devices installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Support! Environment Pro is reliable and truly appreciated us and our situation. We got back one evening to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could look for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely happy to have a heated home once again. What's most incredible was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to assist us right before a holiday, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my friends.<p>

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts which sudden shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>

<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan need to spin. If the compressor begins but the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you've given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
