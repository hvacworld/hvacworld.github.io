<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service at Montegut LA</h3>
<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that handles indoor air quality issues. In the lack of such legislation, the "basic task stipulation" applies. This clause, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, mentions that an employer must provide a healthy and safe work environment. Thus, making sure the air is of excellent quality is the employer's task.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
