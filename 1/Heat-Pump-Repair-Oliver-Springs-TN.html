<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri.

<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 48 hours might become a source for mold growth and need to be discarded. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can prosper in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, chances are there will be mold growing close by. Repair the moisture issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
