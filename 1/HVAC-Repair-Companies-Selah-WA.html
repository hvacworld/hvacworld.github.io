<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
