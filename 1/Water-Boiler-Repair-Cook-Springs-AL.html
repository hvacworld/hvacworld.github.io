<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the unit. Loose, missing or malfunctioning wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves examining the suggested connections as well as temperature and pressure assesses. Take time to check these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and protected.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming common features of eco-friendly homes as part of the growing green building motion.
