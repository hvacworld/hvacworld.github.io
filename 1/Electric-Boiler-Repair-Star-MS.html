<h3>Air Condition Repairing in Star MS</h3>
<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it could flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed simply a few years back.<p>
