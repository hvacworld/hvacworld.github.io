<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor impurities.
