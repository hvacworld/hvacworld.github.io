<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on.

Nevertheless, choose your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Think about prospective impacts of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system.

While a space heater is in use, open a door from the space where the heater is located to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
