<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is likely that it is supported by the plumbing. Set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be replaced.<p>

<p>When setting up radiant heat, you need to give serious thought to the type of flooring covering in the home. Due to the fact that it conducts and shops heat, ceramic tile works well.
