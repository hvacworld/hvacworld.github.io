<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
