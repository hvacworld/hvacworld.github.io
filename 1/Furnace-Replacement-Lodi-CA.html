<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
