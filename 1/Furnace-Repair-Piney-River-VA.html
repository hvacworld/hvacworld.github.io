In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top ecological danger to the health of children in the United States." There are many ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was understood how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, fuel, pipes, and numerous other items.<p>
