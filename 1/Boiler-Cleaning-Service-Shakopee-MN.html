What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
