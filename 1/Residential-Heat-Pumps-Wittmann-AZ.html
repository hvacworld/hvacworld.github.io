Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Many HVAC business owners don't realize they require different pricing schemes for various services that their company uses. For instance, residential HVAC installation must be priced differently from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service need to be priced in a different way from duct cleaning.

This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
