<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty.
