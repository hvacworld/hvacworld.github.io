<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
