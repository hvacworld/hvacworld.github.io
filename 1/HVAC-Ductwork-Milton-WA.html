<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized.
