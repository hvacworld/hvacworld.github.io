<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
