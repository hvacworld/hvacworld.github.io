<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
