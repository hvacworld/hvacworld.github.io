<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
