<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
