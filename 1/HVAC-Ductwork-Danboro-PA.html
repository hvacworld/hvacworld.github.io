<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Necessary Service in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which may be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can indicate significant cost savings in annual heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage heaters increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>For instance, pollutants may gather within the air diffusers and grills, presenting pollutants into the environment. Or if the outside air consumption is located near a source of wetness or other outdoor pollutant, it might serve as a path to bring the pollutants inside.

The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy section recommends that "Air Purification should have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are utilized to minimize the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can work as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can lower the performance of the coils.<p>
