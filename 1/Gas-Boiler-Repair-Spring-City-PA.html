<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on numerous house effectiveness upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us debate which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's product and services was impressive. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the essential electrical enhancements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
