<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Campus IL</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>
