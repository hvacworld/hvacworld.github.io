A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, see Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
