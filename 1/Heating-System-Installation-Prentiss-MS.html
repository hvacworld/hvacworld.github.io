<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
