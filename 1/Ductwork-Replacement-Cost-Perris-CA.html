<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
