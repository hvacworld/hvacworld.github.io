<h3>Central Heating System in Abbeville GA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Velocity System since of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
