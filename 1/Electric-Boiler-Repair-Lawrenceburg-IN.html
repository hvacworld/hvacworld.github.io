<p>There are 2 main types of radiant floor heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating organisation. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are forced to resist existing, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
