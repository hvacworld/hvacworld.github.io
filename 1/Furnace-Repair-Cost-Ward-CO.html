<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

For instance, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar energy depends on routine sunshine to work efficiently.
