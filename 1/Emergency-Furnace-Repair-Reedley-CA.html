You may look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and effectiveness if you currently have a house heating system.

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
