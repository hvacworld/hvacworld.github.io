<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it might suck up to twice the electrical power that even a low-end new one would use.

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed just a few years back.<p>
