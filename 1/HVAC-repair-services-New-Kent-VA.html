<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a simple and reliable  technique to reduce ambient air pollution and possible health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
