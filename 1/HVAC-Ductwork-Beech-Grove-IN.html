<h3>Significance Of HVAC And Its Function in Beech Grove IN</h3>
<p>The icing issue becomes a lot more severe with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more conventional kind of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
