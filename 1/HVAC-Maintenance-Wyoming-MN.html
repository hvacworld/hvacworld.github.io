<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, houses and schools matters, especially since we spend the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, however in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the a/c is extra-large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the ac system will require more energy to cool your home. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c are more energy effective than designs made even 5 years ago, so it makes monetary sense to replace or update your system if it's five years old or older. The very best central air conditioning conditioner you can buy today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the exact same amount of cooling.<p>

<p>Furnaces as they age run the risk of developing cracks in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide gas, if present, might leak into your home undetected. Signs of this may be frequent headaches, a burning sensation in nose or eyes, nausea, disorientation, flu-like symptoms.

Fractures in the heat exchanger can happen undetected which is why nobody encourages waiting till they happen.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
