<p>Info provided in this safety guide is based upon existing clinical and technical understanding of the problems provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies.

<p>The toxins listed in this guide have been shown to trigger the health effects discussed. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily true that the results noted happen at the pollutant concentration levels typically found in the home.

<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are used to seeing this type in the backyards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the home. However, there are some internal elements too.
