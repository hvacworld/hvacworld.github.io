<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
