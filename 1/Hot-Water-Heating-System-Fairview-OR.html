<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for property owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, given that the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best choice for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
