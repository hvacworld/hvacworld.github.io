<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The most typical type of home heating unit in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With a typical cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least costly option, but more recent systems can be really energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems typically attain a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, extremely effective natural gas heaters can achieve AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure."
