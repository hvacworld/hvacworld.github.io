<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Tar Heel NC</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Before cooling or installing any brand-new heating system in a home, it is essential to re examine and reduce the energy load of the house. A more energy effective home will not only lower the cost of a brand-new system and utility costs, however it will considerably improve the convenience of your home. Before we design and set up any systems, we arrange a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Basic improvements generally consist of adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can advise a number of competent house Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact United States for references.<p>
