<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

<h3>The Way to Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Warren IN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
