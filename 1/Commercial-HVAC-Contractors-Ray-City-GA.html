<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Ray City GA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in home building is to lower air leak through fractures and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofs. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept clean since an air conditioner moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
