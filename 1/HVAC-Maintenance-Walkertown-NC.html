<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the technicians believed they just didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces are typically not very effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but a lot of do not attain an efficiency higher than 90%. A few high-end brands have an efficiency of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more pricey, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Since a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
