<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Ivesdale IL Home</h3>
<p>Sean was really practical. He is a very pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>

<p>I normally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
