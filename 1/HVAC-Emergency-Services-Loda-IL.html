<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that handles indoor air quality issues. In the absence of such legislation, the "general responsibility provision" uses.

Hence, ensuring the air is of great quality is the company's task.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Ensure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
