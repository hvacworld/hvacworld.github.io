<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
