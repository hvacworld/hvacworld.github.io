<p>Sean was very practical. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor.
