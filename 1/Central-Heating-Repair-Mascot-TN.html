<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ¬∞ C (40-55 ¬∞ F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
