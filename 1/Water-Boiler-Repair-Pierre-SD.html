<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Pierre SD</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in house building is to lower air leak through fractures and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofs. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air assists and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the home.<p>
