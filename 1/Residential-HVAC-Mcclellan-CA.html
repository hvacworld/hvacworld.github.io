<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
