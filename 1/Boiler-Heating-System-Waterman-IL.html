<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working when they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. The copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue.
