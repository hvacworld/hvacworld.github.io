<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge contaminants.)
