<p>We take a look at hints before we offer guidance to replace rather than repair a heating system. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy.

It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older unit.<p>
