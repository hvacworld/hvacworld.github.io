Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
