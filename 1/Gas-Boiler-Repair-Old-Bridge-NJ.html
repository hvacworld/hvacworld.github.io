<h3>Check Out Ductwork In Old Bridge NJ Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
