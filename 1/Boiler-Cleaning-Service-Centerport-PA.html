<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
