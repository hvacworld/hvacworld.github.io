<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
