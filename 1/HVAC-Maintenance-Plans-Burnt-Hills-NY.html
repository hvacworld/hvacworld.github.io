The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
