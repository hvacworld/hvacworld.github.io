<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractor in Jenks</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern a/c) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
