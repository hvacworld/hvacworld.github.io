<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Lebanon IL</h3>
<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no pollutant sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stale air might also be a problem.<p>
<p>We're investing a lot more time inside, these days. While many people assume contamination is simply an outside problem, your house (and workplace) can also be polluted. As a society, we ensure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we do not believe sufficient about direct exposure to all the things we place in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a big impact on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- right away, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe simpler.<p>

<h3>Getting Through Central Heating Installation in Lebanon IL</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on different house performance upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's product and services was impressive. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the needed electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
