<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema.
