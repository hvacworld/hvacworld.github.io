<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
