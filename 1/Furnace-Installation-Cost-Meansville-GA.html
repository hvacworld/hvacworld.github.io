<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
