Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
