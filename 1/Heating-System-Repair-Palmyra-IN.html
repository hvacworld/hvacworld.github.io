<p>A health questionnaire need to be developed and distributed to all worried employees. Such a tool ought to determine the number of people impacted; define ages and job descriptions of involved workers; determine where they lie within the office; suggest when the symptoms take place (time of day, day of week, and season); offer a list of specific health signs or health problems; determine all machines run in the office; indicate the type of outdoors air contamination; and determine potential sources of job tension.<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>

Review of this data may recognize potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping track of information might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
