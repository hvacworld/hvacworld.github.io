I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again.
