<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly efficient, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a continuous temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling impact. Many ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every single system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it really rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
