<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a reliable and simple method to lower ambient air pollution and prospective health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Generally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might select to change the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit.
