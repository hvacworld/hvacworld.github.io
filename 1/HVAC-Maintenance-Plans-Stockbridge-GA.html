<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Stockbridge GA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance.

<p>Central air systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs.
