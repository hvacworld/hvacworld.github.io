<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
