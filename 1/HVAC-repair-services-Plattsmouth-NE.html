<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in moist air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold growth and pollution. Naturally, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the development of germs and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
