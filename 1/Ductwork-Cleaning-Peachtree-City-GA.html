<h3>HVAC System in Peachtree City GA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit, think about possible effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, especially guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating unit remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the rest of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
