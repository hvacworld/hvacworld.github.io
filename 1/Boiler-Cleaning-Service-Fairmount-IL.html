<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently greater wages for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or just a high level of competitors for experienced trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest typical salaries for HVAC specialists at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 per year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

<p>In addition to getting the big picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality display can be established to supply threshold alerts. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your tracking devices to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the proper action to solve the situation instantly.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Approximately 40 percent seldom or never clean their humidifier or kitchen variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
