<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce pollutants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
