<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce pollutants.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
