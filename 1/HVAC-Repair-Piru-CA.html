<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
