<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil change in your car. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high use months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
