<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the visit. They advised replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was really delighted they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Right Furnace Repair at Lacey WA</h3>
<p>The majority of people are aware that outside air contamination can affect their health, however indoor air contamination can also have significant, harmful effect. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air toxins show that indoor levels of pollutants might be 2 to 5 times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air pollution among the top 5 ecological health risks to the general public.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
