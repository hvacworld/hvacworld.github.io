<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other kinds of a/c unit, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to preserve and understand.<p>
