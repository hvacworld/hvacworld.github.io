<h3>Install New Air Conditioner in Ashwood OR</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>There are some more severe dangers for HVAC workers that might be potentially fatal. They can be exposed to Carbon monoxide gas which can be harmful.

The inside unit got the exact same precise observation and care. Extremely polite and constantly compulsively putting on shoe covers when coming within.
