<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a large seller who asked not to be called because he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that routinely monitors energy usage and temperatures in shops to save money on costs (particularly at night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the stores change beyond an appropriate range that could prevent consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>The primary health result associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may position risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
