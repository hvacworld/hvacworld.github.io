I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
