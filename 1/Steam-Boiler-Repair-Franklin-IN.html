<p>IÃ¢ $ m truly picky with my things. I like my devices and home appliances original, I wonÃ¢ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home.
