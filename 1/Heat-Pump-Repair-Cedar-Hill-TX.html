<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>
