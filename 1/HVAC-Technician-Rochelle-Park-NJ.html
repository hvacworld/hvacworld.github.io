PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While room cooling provides maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
