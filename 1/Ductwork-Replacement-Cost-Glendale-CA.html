(If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>

This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
