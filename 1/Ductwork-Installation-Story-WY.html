<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to assess scenario & chose to opt for them for the work. I am happy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but also replaced the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke with from starting to end were very expert, polite and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>We look at hints before we provide guidance to replace instead of repair a heater. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher every year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older system.<p>
