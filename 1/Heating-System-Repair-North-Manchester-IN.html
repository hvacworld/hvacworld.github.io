<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise a choice for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are great for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, since the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically only readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best option for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
