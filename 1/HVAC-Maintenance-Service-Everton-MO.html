<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are prone to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat offers heat from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
