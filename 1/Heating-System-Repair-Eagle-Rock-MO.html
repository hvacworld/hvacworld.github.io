<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Eagle Rock MO</h3>
<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Fantastic Item! Delivery was kind of strange being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact.
