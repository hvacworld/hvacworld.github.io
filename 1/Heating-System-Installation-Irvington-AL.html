<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was needed and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater because the specialists thought they simply didn't seem best and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>

<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square footage. They utilize a series of calculations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs needed to heat the area. The larger the space, the more powerful the house heating unit needs to be.

<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
