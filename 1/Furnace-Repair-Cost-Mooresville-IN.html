<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to run because it just takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
