<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, considering that it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
