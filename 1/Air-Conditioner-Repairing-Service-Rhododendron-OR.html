<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
