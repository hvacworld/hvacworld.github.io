<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Through regular usage and the system's existence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning unit may end up being really filthy. These elements of the devices are essential for efficient air conditioning. The technician cleans all elements, and inspects connections to guarantee they are protected.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
