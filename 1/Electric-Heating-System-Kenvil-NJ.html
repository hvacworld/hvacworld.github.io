<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Kenvil NJ</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We decided on getting something more expensive than a standard water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
