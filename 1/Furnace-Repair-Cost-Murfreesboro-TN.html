Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current survey by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
