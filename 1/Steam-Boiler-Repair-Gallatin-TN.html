These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect. Many ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for every single system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
