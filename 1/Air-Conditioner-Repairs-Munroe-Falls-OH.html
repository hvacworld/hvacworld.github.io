<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
