<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install assessment results look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 heap R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
