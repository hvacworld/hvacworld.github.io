Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
