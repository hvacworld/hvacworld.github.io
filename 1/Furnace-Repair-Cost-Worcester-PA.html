<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a referral later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>

What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
