<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
