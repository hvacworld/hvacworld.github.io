<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy.
