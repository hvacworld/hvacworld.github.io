<p>Generally the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
