<p>Remember, too, that you might want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a home heater, you might look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to search for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or extremely hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, frequently described as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
