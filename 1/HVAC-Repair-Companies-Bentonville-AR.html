<p>Instantaneous discounts on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are available to devices installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Exceptional Customer Care! Climate Pro is trusted and truly cared about us and our situation. We got home one night to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could search for and purchase it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely happy to have a heated home once again. What's most remarkable was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to assist us right before a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly recommend this company to my friends.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
