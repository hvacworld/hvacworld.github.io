<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your employer ought to examine measurements of humidity, temperature level and air circulation. In addition, assessment and screening of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to make sure it is working according to specs for building use and tenancy) should be performed. A building walk-through to check for smells and look for water damage, leaks, dirt or insect droppings may be useful. Leakages need to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become contaminated with bacteria or fungi and require to be eliminated, also. In some scenarios, specific screening for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of building occupancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>A customized air conditioning system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the exact same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, since all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is really warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
