<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
