<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

Much like other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0.
