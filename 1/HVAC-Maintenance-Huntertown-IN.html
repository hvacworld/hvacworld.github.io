The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in over half the office indoor air investigations it has actually carried out.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
