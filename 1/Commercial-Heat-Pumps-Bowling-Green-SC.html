<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material over time.

Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
