<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>A regular furnace tune up can go a long method towards lessening a number of the issues brought on by build-up of dirt and particles, and the inspections allow your contractor to keep an eye on longer-term concerns and take proactive steps to help prevent premature failure or bothersome breakdowns throughout the heating season. Annual furnace service may also be a requirement to keep your furnace guarantee valid as well. Lots of manufacturers state on guarantee documentation that installation and maintenance by a certified HVAC company are a part of the guarantee conditions. When you have a ten-year parts restricted warranty as is standard on Carrier ® heating systems, you'll want to make certain you keep that protection valid for the full 10 years.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
