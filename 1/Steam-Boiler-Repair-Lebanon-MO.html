<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
