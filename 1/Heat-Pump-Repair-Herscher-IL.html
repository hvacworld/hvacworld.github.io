The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future.

Excess wetness can cause problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the property, unequal temperature policy, bacteria, and jeopardized air quality. An expert maintenance technician will flush and clean up the condensate drain to guarantee all excess wetness streams away from the system.<p>
