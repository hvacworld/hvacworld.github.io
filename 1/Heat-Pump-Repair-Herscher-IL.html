The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your a/c and heat pump ought to be devoid of all clogs and particles.

Excess wetness can cause problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the property, unequal temperature policy, bacteria, and jeopardized air quality. An expert maintenance technician will flush and clean up the condensate drain to guarantee all excess wetness streams away from the system.<p>
