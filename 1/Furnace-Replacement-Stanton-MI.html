<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor impurities and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
