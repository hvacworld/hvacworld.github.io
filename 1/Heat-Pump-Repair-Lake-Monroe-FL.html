The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
