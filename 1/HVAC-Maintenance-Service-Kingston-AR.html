<p>Numerous elements impact IAQ. These factors consist of poor ventilation (absence of outdoors air), issues controlling temperature level, low or high humidity, recent remodeling, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air entering into the structure. Often, specific contaminants like dust from building and construction or restoration, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals launched as a gas with time) might trigger poor IAQ.<p>
