<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

A home warmed by a radiant system will heat up faster, and remain warm with less energy invested. These are just a few of the lots of advantages that a radiant heat system can provide you.<p>
