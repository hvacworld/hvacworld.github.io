<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be serious. They include hold-ups in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Kids, fetuses, and babies are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults considering that lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more conscious the destructive results of lead. Children might have greater exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
