<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Airway Heights WA Home Owners</h3>
<p>Pricing for furnace service and maintenance will differ widely from dealer to dealer, for a variety of reasons.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
