However, you'll save cash over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as conventional air-source systems. The lack of moving parts means you're less most likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years.
