Because it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
