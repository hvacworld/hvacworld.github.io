<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold might be living in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. There are several design methods in use today; however, all ground source heatpump run with similar concepts. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources likewise dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>

If it becomes wet, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>
