<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
