<h3>HVAC Installation in Swayzee IN</h3>
<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to examine circumstance & decided to choose them for the work. I enjoy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke with from starting to end were very expert, polite and the work was really efficiently done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts decades, given that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my needs entirely by offering a professional quote with options, without pressing extra products. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also promptly followed up with the essential examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
