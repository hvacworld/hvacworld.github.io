Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively simple procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
