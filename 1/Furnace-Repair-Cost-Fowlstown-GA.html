<p>There is no simple response, but many use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a better option.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to provide sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
