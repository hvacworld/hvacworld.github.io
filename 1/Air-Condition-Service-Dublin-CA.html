<h3>Everything You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Dublin CA</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in home building is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, roofs, and floors. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
