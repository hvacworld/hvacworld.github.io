<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
