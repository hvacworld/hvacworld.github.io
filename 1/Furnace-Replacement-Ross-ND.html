In the approaching year, property owners in Westminster will be required to install higher efficiency heaters if they are having actually a furnace changed. The brand-new furnace models are more efficient, which suggests they are better for the environment but they are also more costly.

<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the very first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and very large houses. Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, due to the fact that the absence of moving parts makes them less susceptible to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
