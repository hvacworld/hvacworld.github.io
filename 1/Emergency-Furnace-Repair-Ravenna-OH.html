Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that frequently, our nationally representative study found. Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they use it daily.

All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
