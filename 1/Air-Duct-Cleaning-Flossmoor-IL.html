<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
