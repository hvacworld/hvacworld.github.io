<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably reduces exposure to pollutants throughout cooking. Incorrect modification, often shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you acquire a brand-new gas stove or range, think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot burner that burns constantly. Never ever use a gas range to heat your home. When the fireplace is in use, always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
