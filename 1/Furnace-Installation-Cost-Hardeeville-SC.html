<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>

So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service strategy which normally consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
