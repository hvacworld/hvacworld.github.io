<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
