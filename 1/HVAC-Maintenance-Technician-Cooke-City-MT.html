Heaters that kick on frequently might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
