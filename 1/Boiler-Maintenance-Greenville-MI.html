<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently higher earnings for air conditioning tradesmen. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or merely a high level of competition for competent trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest typical earnings for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that perfect temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service strategy which generally consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>The primary health effect related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
