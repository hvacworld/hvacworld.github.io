<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>

<p>Although installation is simple and does not require much time, attempting this job is not an excellent concept.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
