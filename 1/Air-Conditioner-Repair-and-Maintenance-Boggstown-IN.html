<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too.

<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance gos to each year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and normally some other advantages. Some companies use concern visits to their maintenance plan members.<p>
