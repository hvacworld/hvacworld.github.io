<p>We take a look at ideas before we provide suggestions to change instead of repair a heating system. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older unit.<p>

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
