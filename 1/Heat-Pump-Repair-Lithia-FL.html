<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees stay in place.

For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature deterioration, causing holes and cracks. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.  a very beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
