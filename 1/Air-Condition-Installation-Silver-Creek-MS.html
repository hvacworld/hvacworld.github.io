<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can afford, many Seattleites must find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a vicious, terrible summer season.<p>
<p>The primary health effect related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
