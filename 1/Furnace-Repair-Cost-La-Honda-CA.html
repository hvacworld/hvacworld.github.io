<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his examination, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by many people.<p>
