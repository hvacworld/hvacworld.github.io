It does not depend on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The split system is the most typical. The majority of people are utilized to seeing this type in the backyards of houses. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the house. However, there are some internal parts too. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous rooms at once, however are not extremely energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house. At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might spend more money on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Ventilation, air and heating Conditioning, and refers to the climate control systems installed in houses or commercial properties. Their task is to move heated or cooled filtered air throughout the structure, to keep occupants of the structure comfy. Literally every structure in Columbus or Franklin County, Ohio or the United States has some sort of environment control system set up.<p>
