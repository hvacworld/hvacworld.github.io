<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heat pumps operate on electricity and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like a space heater) with the exact same amount of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Whatever heating system you install, it's vital that it's sized properly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should.
