<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%.
