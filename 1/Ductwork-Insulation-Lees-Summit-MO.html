The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work started.
