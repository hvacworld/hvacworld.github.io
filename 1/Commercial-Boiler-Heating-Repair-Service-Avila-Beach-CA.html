What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives.
