Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems.

Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is described as radiant heat.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
