<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>While toxins commonly found in indoor air are accountable for many harmful results, there is considerable unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are necessary to produce particular illness.
