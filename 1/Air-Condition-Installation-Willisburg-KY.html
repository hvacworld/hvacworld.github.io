<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
