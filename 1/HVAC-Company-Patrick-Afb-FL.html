Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>
