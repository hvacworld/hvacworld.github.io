A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
