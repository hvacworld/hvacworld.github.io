<h3>The Way to Get the Best Gas Furnace For Your Home in Dolomite AL</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics recently, however I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
