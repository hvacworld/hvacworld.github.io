<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants set off allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Contagious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing toxic substances. Symptoms of health problems triggered by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleepiness, fever, and digestion issues.<p>
<p>Consider prospective results of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, particularly instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heater is in usage, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the rest of the house and open a window a little.<p>
