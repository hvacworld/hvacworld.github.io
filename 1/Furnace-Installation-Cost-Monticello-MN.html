<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>While contaminant levels from private sources might not position a substantial health danger on their own, the majority of houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a serious danger from the cumulative results of these sources. Thankfully, there are actions that many people can take both to decrease the danger from existing sources and to prevent new issues from occurring. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to assist you decide whether to act that can lower the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>Though it may be difficult to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for decreasing the air quality in your home, but there are numerous other contaminants that can not just dirty up the air, however result in other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure materials add to poor air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (unstable organic compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery materials can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce contaminants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, people breathe out co2, which in little quantities is not poisonous, however may end up being hazardous if high concentrations are enabled to accumulate. Micro-organisms or germs may also be present within the ventilation system. They might spread throughout the whole workplace or structure by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
