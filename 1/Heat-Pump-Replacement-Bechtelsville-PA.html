An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.

A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
