<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Lowry City MO</h3>
<p>MAINTENANCE PLANS: Your HVAC system is an investment that spends for itself over the years, but just if you protect it to the very best of your ability.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
