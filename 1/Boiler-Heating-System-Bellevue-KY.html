<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house via ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for performance.

If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward process. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>
