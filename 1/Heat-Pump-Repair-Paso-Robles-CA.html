<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, many of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
