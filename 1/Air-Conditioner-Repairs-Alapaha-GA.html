<p>House heating systems are made complex systems that need the services of a contractor to set up. While you can certainly purchase your furnace yourself, many contractors will not service warranty the furnace or might not install it if you do not buy it from them. Installation charges differ throughout the county, but start at approximately $50 per hour up to $150 or more. It takes around 5 hours to install a little furnace and more to install a large one.<p>
<p>There are a few possibilities to discuss brief cycling in extremely cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands put on the system due to the extremely low temperature levels. In some cases, the furnace will just run harder to keep a warm climate for your house when the weather condition is exceptionally cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you require clarity on this concern, contact one of our technicians.<p>
