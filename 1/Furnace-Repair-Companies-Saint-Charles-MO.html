<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. Connection concerns along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the system. Loose, faulty or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service.

<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heat pumps work on electricity and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
