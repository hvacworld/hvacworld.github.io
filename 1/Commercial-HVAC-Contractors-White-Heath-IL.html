<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
