<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtering. From one of the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some fundamental maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants flowing through your system.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
