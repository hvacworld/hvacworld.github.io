<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, many of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>The primary health result associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
