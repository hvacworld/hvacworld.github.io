<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated efficiency benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Since an unit is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
