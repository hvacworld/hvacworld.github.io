<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is generally greater than many heatpump choices, they can still be highly effective, depending upon the model you acquire.

This means it can warm up your home to the desired temperature quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside ought to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
