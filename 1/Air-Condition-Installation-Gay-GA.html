<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems in Gay GA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We picked getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
