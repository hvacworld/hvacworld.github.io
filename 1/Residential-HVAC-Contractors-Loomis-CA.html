<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to check the a/c before you buy.

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
