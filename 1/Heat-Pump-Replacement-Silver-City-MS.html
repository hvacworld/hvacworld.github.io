Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>
