<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>

While weatherization is underway, however, actions should also be taken to minimize contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, residents must be alert to the development of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth.
