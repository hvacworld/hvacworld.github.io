<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Wales Center NY</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely delighted that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the air conditioning unit prior to you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad.

Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
