<p>Radiant heat offers a number of unique advantages over forced air heater. For example, radiant heating systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They don't have to stress over duct leaks, which are responsible for output losses of as much as 30% in other heater types. Sending heat through strong objects will also trigger it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A house heated up by a radiant system will warm up quicker, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are simply a few of the many benefits that a radiant heating system can provide you.<p>
