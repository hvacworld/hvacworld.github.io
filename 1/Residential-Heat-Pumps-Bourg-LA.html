<p>All Points Heating offers house cooling, air conditioner installation, ac system maintenance that provide trustworthy, proven efficiency at high effectiveness. Combustion products from car exhaust, furnaces, hot water heater, space heating systems, scented candles, oil lights, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not correctly vented can produce carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion products might result in eye, nose, and throat irritation; fatigue; lightheadedness; and queasiness.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
