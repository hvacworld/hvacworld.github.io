<h3>Strategies for Quick Furnace Repair at San Mateo CA</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
