<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
