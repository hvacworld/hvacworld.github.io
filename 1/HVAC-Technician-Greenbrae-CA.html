Carbon monoxide gas is a common air pollutant resulting from gas that leaves into your house without being burnt. Older houses may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchen areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where moisture levels are typically higher than in the rest of your house.<p>

The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on occupants-- outdoors air should be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
