<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
