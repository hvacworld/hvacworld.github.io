<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>The heat pump gained popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can extract heat from various sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Heat pumps transfer heat from outside the structure into the air inside. At first, heatpump HVAC systems were only used in moderate environments, but with improvements in low temperature operation and minimized loads due to more effective homes, they are increasing in appeal in cooler climates.<p>
<p>Additionally, house owners have a range of options to pick from in powering a flooring heater. Glowing systems work with electrical, gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources. As many house owners are all too mindful, tradition furnace systems are usually limited to running on a single energy source, such as heating oil. If the marketplace for that energy source turns volatile, rates can vary, rates spike and you can end up paying more to heat your home no matter how low you set your thermostat.<p>
