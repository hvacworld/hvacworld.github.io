<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, human beings breathe out co2, which in little amounts is not harmful, however might become harmful if high concentrations are permitted to collect. Germs or micro-organisms may likewise be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread throughout the whole work environment or building by methods of the ventilation system.<p>
