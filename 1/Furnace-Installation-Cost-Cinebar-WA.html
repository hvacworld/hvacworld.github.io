Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
