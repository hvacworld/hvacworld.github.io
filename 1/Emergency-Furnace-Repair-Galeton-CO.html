<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
