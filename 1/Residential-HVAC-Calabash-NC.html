<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
