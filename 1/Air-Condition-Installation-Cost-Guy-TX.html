<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Service in Guy</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as an Essential Company in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% efficiency or better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can indicate significant savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase performance even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor unit as near the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
