<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the higher temperature levels often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to offer thermal convenience indoors. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold development and wetness indoors is connected with a higher frequency of resident respiratory problems.<p>
