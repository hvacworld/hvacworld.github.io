<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
