<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no contaminant sources are discovered. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not enough to account for a boost in the number of workers in the location, stagnant air might also be a problem.<p>
<p>Choosing the best size a/c unit is a crucial part of the HVAC purchasing process and one that you'll need an HVAC expert to help you with. Here's why purchasing the ideal size air conditioning unit matters: if you buy an HVAC system that's too big, you'll wind up losing cash and energy. And if it's too small, you won't get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfy.<p>

Local building regulations most likely define the amount (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that ought to be continuously supplied in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation paired with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
