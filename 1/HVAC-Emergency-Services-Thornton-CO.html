<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow higher air flow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and brand-new air purification technologies are ending up being more typical as offered solutions in residential and commercial HVAC product bundles.

<p>Finally, if you do identify a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heating system and choose to install it in your house, you might be qualified for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses. (And these costs can be considerable. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, homeowners can expect to pay between $6 and $16 per square foot, not including tax and labor, for a radiant heat system.)

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
