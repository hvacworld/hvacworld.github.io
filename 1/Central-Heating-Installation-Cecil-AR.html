<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer season.

Part of maintaining your furnace involves checking the suggested connections in addition to temperature and pressure determines. Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and safe.<p>

The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins however the fan doesn't. Turn off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan begins. , if it does not, you have actually given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
