<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically described as central air" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floorings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
