<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to run because it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
