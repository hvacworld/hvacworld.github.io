<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Building and Commissioning is created for architects, style engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include building materials, smoking cigarettes, household products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heaters.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
