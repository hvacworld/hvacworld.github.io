Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils.

It likewise prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
