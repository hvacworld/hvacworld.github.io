<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, nowadays. While many people assume contamination is just an outdoor issue, your home (and workplace) can also be polluted. As a society, we ensure that our houses are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we do not believe enough about exposure to all the important things we put in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge impact on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- immediately, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While room air conditioning offers maximum versatility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>
