As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most current science for NO2.

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the tools or abilities essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and correct airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however homeowners do not have the needed devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
