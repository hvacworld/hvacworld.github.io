<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most inexpensive if your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>We look at hints before we supply suggestions to change rather than repair a heating unit. One of the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older system.<p>

Robaire has actually been my choice given that I have become a homeowner over 18 years back. They have actually installed 2 Trane heating & cooling systems to keep our whole house comfy. They also carry out all service work on my rental properties also. Their techs get here when they state they will and the rates is competitive. They make the effort to describe the repairs and make ideas on how you can make your system more energy and cost effective. If you require HVAC work, provide a call, you will not be dissatisfied.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for replacing a 17 year old AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who described our options did an outstanding task in ensuring we understood the benefits and drawbacks of each option. The technicians who set up the new system were expert and fast, while taking time to ensure we understood how the new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>
