<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
