<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can become clogged with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down totally.

As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
