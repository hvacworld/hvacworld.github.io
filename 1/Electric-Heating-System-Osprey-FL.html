<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

This is no longer the realm of the lone hacker however rather around the world, the mob and they are much better financed and staffed than any of us could ever be.<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
