However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request.

He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
