<p>If your a/c is more than 8 years old, repair is probably not worth the expenditure, unless it's a simple problem like particles obstructing the condenser system or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to assess not simply the condition of your existing devices, however also the ducts that provide the cool air and the general quality of the insulation in your home.
