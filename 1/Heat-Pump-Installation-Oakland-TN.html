<h3>Suggestions to Avoid Furnace Repairing Costs in Oakland TN</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We chose getting something more pricey than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
