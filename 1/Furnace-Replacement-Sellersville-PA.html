Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again.
