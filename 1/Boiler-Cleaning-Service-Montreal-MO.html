<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the compressor, condenser, and evaporator are all located in one cabinet, which normally is put on a roofing system or on a concrete piece beside your home's structure. This kind of air conditioning unit also is used in small commercial buildings.

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can afford, many Seattleites need to find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a cruel, harsh summer.<p>
