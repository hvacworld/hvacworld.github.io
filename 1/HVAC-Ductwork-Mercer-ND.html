Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were very professional, considerate and the work was really effectively done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

From there you can take the suitable action to deal with the circumstance instantly.<p>
