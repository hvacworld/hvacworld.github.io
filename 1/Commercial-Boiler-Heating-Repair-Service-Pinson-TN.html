<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

The higher the system's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
