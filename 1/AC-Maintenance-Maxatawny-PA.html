<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Make sure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
