<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the very first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial buildings, apartment and huge houses. Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago stay operable, because the absence of moving parts makes them less susceptible to tear and use.

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today.

<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems.

PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While space air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
