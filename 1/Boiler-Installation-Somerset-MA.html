<p>Central air units are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
