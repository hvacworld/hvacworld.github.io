<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures in some cases used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions.
