<p>Airborne irritants are simply a reality of life. Molds can cause flare-ups of allergic reaction signs, and in some cases, trigger asthma attacks. Germs, bacteria, and infections also can live in the air you breathe every day. These air-borne pollutants can impact your home convenience devices, too.

The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.

The radiators may be mounted on walls or set up within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
