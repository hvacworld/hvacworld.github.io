<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name.

The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel extremely hot. Only be worried if your home is not warming up. However, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must call in a specialist to repair the unit and check.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my companies, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He assisted me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is sincere, trustworthy, and sensible on cost. It's tough to discover a sincere AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

Likewise they identified the problem and fixed really quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
