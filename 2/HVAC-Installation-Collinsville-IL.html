Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and extreme wetness, presents outdoors air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensor, think about the height at which they should be positioned. A lot of frequently they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if people primarily remain seated in that particular location. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the flooring or ceiling; depending on what pollutant you're attempting to track you'll need to put the sensing unit appropriately. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside structures are generally near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>
