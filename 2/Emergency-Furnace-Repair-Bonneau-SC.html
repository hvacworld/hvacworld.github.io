Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
