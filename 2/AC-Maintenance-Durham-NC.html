Heatpump operate on electrical power and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
