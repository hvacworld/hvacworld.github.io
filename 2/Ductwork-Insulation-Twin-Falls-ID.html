<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was type of weird being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved issues.
