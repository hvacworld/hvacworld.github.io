<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Ventilation plays an important role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those procedures consist of bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
