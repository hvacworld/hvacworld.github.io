<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>These people have actually been fantastic. At a real estate agent, I sometimes require contractors to provide me an opinion for what work on a home might cost. Recently I required to get in touch with these men twice. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my client probably would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Stability isn't just their name, it's an organisation design they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Speak to you quickly.<p>

However, some manufacturers need routine maintenance as a regard to the guarantee.<p>
