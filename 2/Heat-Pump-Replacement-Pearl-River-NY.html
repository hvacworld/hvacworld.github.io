I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Am happy I got this though due to the fact that it has actually restored my faith in great manufacturing.
