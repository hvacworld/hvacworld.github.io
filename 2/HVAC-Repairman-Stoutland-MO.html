<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
