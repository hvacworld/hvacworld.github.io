<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps run on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like a space heating unit) with the very same amount of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
