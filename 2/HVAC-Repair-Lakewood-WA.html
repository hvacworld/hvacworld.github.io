<h3>AC Duct Repair in Lakewood WA</h3>
<p>If no pollutant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stagnant air might also be an issue when ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of employees in the location.<p>
<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to offer thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold development and moisture inside your home is related to a greater prevalence of occupant breathing problems.<p>
