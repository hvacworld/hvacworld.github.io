<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
