<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Cedar Falls IA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We decided on getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is among our most significant energy costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was very thorough and on-time in describing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn supplied excellent customer service at the end of the consultation by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance jobs we may want to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques utilized by some in the market.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to provide adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
