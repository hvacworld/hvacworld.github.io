<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator requires handled by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
