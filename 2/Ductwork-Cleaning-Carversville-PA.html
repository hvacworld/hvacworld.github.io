<p>Immediate discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are readily available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Exceptional Client Service! Climate Pro is reliable and truly appreciated us and our situation. We got home one evening to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that exact same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could look for and purchase it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely grateful to have a heated house once again. What's most fantastic was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to help us right before a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily recommend this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Location the solar storage tank near the standard water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available.

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your car. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter once every three months. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
