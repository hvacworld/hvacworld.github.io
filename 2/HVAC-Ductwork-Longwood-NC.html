<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Longwood NC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Since it just takes more electrical power to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
