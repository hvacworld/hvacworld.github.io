<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
