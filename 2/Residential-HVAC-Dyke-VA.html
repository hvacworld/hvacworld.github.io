<p>Measurement treatments are being established and shown to examine structure ventilation and indoor contaminant concentrations. These procedures vary from advanced tracer gas methods utilized primarily in developing research study efforts to less involved treatments that can be utilized by building operators.

The efforts in which these procedures are demonstrated in the field has led to the development of an important database of building ventilation and indoor air quality efficiency.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide must be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly might become clogged up, lowering air flow volume, distribution, and quality. They also might end up being locations for germs and molds to be and grow dispersed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also need to be appropriately maintained to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floorings, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
