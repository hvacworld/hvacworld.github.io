<h3>AC Maintenance in Friant CA</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.

<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Friant CA</h3>
