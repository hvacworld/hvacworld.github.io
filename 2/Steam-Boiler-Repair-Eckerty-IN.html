<p>I have actually been using them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to find a truthful AC person and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new heaters can heat your home.

<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in location. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is frequently tough to measure, as one reaction mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or ac system don't just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of repeated usage of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, leading to fractures and holes. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.. a really helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
