<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the home. Pollutants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below. An air toxin could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care items. Germs and infections, animal dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can manage, so many Seattleites need to discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as soon as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a harsh, harsh summertime.<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
