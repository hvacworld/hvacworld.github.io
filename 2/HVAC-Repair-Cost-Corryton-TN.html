This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
