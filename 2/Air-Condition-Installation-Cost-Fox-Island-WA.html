<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled.

Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
