<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
