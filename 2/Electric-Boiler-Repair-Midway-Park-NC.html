<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Many typical structure materials used prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials.

<p>Increasing energy costs are not the only reason for high costs. Furnaces typically lose their effectiveness as they age, especially if they have not been appropriately preserved. As a result your oil or natural gas furnace may run longer to supply the very same amount of heat. This will cause your energy costs to increase. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies monthly could be utilized to help you pay for a new, a lot more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your recent heating costs with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a substantial distinction, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>
