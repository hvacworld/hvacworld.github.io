A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>

Radiant heat systems tend to be far more energy efficient than other heaters, for something. Forced air heating unit tend to experience things like duct leaks, which rob them of approximately 30% of their output.

PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heatpump While space air conditioning supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
