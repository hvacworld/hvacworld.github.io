Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
