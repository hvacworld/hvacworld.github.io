<p>For instance, issues develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate appropriate amounts of outside air. Insufficient ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or placed in such a way that outside air does not really reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Poorly located outdoor air intake vents can likewise generate air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
