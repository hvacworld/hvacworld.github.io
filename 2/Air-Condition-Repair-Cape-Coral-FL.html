<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could flatter twice the electrical power that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a specific cooling output.
