<p>Integrity Energy fasted to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heating systems were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the brand-new heaters can heat your home. Honestly, our house heater is complicated, Rob and his group repaired the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>Consider potential impacts of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, especially guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While an area heater remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the rest of the house and open a window a little.<p>
