<p>Some health effects may show up shortly after a single exposure or duplicated direct exposures to a toxin. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are typically short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is merely eliminating the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Soon after exposure to some indoor air toxins, signs of some illness such as asthma might appear, be intensified or gotten worse.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building codes likely define the amount (and often quality) of outside air that must be continually supplied in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation coupled with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be useful in diluting the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires managed by experts, go to Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
