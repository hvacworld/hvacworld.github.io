<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Whether it's the middle of winter or summer season, having a working HVAC system is necessary. At Lowe's, we have a range of heating and cooling systems-- from heaters and heatpump to window a/c and portable air conditioning system Plus, we offer a/c installation and heating installation by licensed professional independent installers. Uncertain if HVAC installation is in your budget plan? We're happy to provide a range of unique funding options.

<p>Inspect these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
