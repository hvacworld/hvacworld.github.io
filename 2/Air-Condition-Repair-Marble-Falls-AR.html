Nevertheless, select your contractor sensibly, much of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
