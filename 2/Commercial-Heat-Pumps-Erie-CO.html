Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
