<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
