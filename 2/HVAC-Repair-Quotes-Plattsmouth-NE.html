They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to order it. My wife said that she had actually seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent people I have actually met in a long time.
