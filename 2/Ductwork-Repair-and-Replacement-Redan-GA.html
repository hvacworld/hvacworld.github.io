A basic air conditioning unit transfers heat energy out of the space because its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, because all elements of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
