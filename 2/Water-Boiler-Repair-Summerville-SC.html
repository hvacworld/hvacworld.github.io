<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
