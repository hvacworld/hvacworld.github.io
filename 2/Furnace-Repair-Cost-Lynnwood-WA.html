Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>

<p>Outside impurities. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants found in outside air can be asthma triggers.
