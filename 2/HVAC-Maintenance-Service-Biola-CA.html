<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently higher salaries for air conditioning tradesmen. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or merely a high level of competitors for competent trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest average earnings for HVAC technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually.

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might observe moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
<p>The early few years of your service are an exciting time, and it's tempting to let pure interest direct your path forward. But if you want your new HVAC business to have staying power, you should go back and devote the necessary time to developing a business plan.

It's a framework to assist the launch or revamp of your organisation that you can build on and restructure as business progresses.<p>
