<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Care Tips in Hampstead NH</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow.

Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
