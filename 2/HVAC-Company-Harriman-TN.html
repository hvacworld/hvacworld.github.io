This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot next to the radiators.
