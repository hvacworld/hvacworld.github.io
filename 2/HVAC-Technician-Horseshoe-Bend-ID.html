<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Vital Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% performance, this can imply significant savings in annual heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by running at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Radiant heat provides a variety of special benefits over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heating systems are more energy effective than forced air systems. They do not have to stress over duct leakages, which are responsible for output losses of as much as 30% in other heater types. Transmitting heat through strong objects will also trigger it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A house heated by a glowing system will warm up much faster, and stay warm with less energy invested. These are simply a few of the lots of advantages that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
