<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants activate allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Transmittable illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing toxins.
