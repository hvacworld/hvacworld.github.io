<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
