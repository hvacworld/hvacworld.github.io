<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils.

It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
