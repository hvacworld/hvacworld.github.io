This is usually utilized in a third-floor or 2nd location and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour.

<p>Chemical pollutants: Volatile natural compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous.

<p>Normally the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative effect on residents-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
