<h3>Tips to Help You Hire Cerro Gordo NC Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>The remainder of the HVAC system likewise requires to be in top condition for the ac system to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the home. The technician can take a look at the ductwork for signs of holes, spaces or excessive dirt if the individual parts are in appropriate order. Sealing leaks in ductwork can enhance HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler home in the hot summertime.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
