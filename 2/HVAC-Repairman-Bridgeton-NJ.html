<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
