<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
