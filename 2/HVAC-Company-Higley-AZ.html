<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Higley AZ</h3>
<p>Most people know that outdoor air pollution can affect their health, however indoor air pollution can also have substantial, hazardous impact. EPA studies of human direct exposure to air pollutants indicate that indoor levels of contaminants might be 2 to five times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air pollution amongst the leading 5 ecological health threats to the public.<p>
<p>Because an ac system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both should be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
