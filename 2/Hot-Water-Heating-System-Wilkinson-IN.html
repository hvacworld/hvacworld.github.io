The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
