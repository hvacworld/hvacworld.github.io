<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
