<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives ask for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>I have used all the time for 5 plus years now. I have actually signed an annual maintenance agreement which covers 2 services every year. Ilan has been great through all these years. Constantly keeps my system serviced and tuned. Haven't had any issues. He informs me about it and proactively repairs the parts Whenever he sees any issues. Very pleased with their service. Would recommend them anytime.<p>

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
