<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
<p>When car a/c systems break down, refrigerant leaks. Not only is refrigerant hazardous to the environment, it's likewise damaging to your car. Dripping refrigerant can harm your automobile's evaporator and compressor. Getting an automobile air conditioner service at the first sign of difficulty will save you both cash and time. Come to Firestone Total Car Care for an AC service repair prior to any damage spreads.<p>
