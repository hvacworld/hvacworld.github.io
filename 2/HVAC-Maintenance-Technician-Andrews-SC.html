<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a referral later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

Such info can in some cases be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative should request that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Evaluation of this data might determine potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data might not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
