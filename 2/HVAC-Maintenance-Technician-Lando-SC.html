<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
