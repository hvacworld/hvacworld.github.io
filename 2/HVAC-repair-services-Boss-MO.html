<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Boss MO HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Prior to you choose a contractor, consider quotes from a minimum of three to five reliable contractors. Talk to your state's contractor's licensing board online to ensure that no consumer grievances have been filed and that the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is legitimate and active. Compare the various furnace efficiency scores recommended by the individual contractors to choose the design and system that finest matches your energy needs. Bear in mind that energy-star ranked equipment will conserve you cash in the end however may involve a greater up-front cost.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
