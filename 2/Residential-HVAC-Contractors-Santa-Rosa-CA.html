(If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
