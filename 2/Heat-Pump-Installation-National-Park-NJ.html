<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.
