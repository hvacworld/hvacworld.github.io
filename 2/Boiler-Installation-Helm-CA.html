These calculations take into account things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is important so the unit isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance visits each year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and generally some other benefits. Some companies use top priority visits to their maintenance plan members.<p>
