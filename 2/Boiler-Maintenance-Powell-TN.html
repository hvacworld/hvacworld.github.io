The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not count on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>

The air conditioner could cycle continuously or behave unpredictably if the sensor is knocked out of position. The sensing unit needs to be near the coil however not touching it; adjust its position by carefully bending the wire that holds it in place.<p>
