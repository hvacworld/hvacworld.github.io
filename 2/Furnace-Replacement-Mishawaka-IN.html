<p>Among the disadvantages of central heating is that it's potentially costly to install, specifically in an older home. Depending upon the type of unit set up, it can be loud and cause problems if you're highly adverse dust. In addition, certain fuels and devices may need unique authorizations, and there is limited flexibility in case of changed heating requirements. During usage, there is a time delay while heat is being carried from the heating unit to the home.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
