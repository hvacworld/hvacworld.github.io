<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
