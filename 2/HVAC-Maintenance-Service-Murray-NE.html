<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>You're motivating the growth of mold in damp air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold development and pollution. Of course, too-dry air can likewise irritate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can add to the development of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
