<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end goal.
