<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
