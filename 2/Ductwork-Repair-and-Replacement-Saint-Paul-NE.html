Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
