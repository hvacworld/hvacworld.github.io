<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a very enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>

<h3>Furnace Company in Van Nuys CA</h3>
<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay products. Since they just partially remove the radon decay items and do not lessen the amount of radon getting in the house, the efficiency of these devices is unpredictable. EPA prepares to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a dependable ways of reducing the health risk from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides more info on air-cleaning devices to minimize indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was very thorough and on-time in explaining what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn offered great customer service at the end of the appointment by describing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might want to have done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale techniques utilized by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
