<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Spot Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans must be set up in all kitchens and bathrooms. These fans eliminate humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most reliable fans are long lasting and peaceful. Use fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls work to guarantee the fans run for a sufficient time period.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
