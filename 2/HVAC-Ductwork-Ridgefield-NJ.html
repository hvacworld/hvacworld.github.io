An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
