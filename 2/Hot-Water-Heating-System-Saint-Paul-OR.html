<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might discover musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk with your doctor about them. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
