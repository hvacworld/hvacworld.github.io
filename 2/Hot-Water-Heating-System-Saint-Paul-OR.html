Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk with your doctor about them. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
