<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Ruckersville VA</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler typically occur. In many cases, the belt is improperly aligned or used and requires replacement. Follow the directions above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
