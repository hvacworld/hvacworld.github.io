However, your option will mainly come down to what your ducts permit or what was formerly in your home. Ask your heating contractor for the most proper choice.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
