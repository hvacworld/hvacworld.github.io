<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that best temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job.

So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which normally consists of a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
