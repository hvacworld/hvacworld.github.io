<p>We look at clues before we offer advice to change instead of repair a heater. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting money by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your family pets to harmful gas leaks.

Older houses might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where wetness levels are normally higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
