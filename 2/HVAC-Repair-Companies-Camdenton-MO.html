<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my services, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
