<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, the majority of frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might go into neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
