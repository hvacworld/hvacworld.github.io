<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Billings MT</h3>
<p>Spot Ventilation. Exterior exhaust fans must be installed in all restrooms and cooking areas. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most reliable fans are quiet and resilient. Use fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls work to guarantee the fans run for an adequate period of time. An excellent guideline is to run a bathroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
