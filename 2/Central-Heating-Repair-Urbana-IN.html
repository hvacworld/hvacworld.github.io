<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room.

<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump.

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is poorly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.
