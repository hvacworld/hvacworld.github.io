<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.
