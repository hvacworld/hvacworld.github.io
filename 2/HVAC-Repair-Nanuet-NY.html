<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized.

Some of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>
