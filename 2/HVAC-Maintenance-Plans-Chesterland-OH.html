The team took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We picked getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
