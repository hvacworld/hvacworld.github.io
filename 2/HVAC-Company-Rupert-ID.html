<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
