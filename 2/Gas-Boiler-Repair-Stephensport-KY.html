The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
