<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that best temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in pricey repairs down the road. So, make certain to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which normally includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
