<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
