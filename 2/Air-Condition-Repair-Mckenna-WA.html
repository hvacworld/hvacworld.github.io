This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to routinely clean the condenser coil.

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Mckenna WA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
