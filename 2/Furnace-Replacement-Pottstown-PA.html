<p>Among the main factors a furnace will run continuously is due to the fact that something is dirty or clogged up Before attempting to fix any problem, take some time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is excellent to go, check the furnace blower for obstructing and tidy it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it.

<p>The bottom line is to secure your financial investment by just utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a licensed agent from a business or retailer to do the installation.
