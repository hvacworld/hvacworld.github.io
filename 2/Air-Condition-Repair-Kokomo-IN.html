From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some basic maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants flowing through your system.
