<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, much of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product.
