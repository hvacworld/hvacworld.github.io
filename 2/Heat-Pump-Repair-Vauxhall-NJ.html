<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the correct temperature level. Furnaces that kick on frequently might be because of a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

The higher the system's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>
