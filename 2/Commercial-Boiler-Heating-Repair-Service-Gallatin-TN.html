<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
