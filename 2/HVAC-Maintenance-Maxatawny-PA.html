<p>If you operate in building, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your hobby involves lead, you might unwittingly bring lead into your home on your clothes or hands.

Soil by roadways and highways may be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes from vehicles and trucks that used leaded gas. Usage door mats to wipe your feet prior to getting in the home. If you work with lead in your job or a hobby, change your clothing prior to you go house and wash these clothing independently.

This company presented a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes.
