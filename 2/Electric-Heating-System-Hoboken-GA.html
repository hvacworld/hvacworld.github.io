<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your animals to harmful gas leakages.

In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where wetness levels are usually greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins.

The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
