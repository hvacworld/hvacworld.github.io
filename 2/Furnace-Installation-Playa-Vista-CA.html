<p>Dometic's commercial grade roof air conditioning system are performance-tested to conquer uncommon or harsh roadway and weather. Numerous basic units break down after just 4 hours of severe vibration testing, while the Brisk II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel top plate offers enduring strength while long copper lines reduce vibration and, for that reason, sound too. While being one of the hardest a/c unit around, its 410A refrigerant is kinder to the environment. Robust, light-weight and capable of carrying out in any environment! It won't let you down.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they detected the problem and fixed very rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were excellent! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my requirements totally by supplying a professional quote with alternatives, without pressing additional products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also promptly followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
