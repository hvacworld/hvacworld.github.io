<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
