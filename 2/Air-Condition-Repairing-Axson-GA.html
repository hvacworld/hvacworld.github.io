<p>We look at ideas before we offer advice to replace rather than repair a heating unit. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older unit.<p>
