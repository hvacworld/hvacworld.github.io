These pollutants choose your furnishings, your woodwork, and even in your lungs. Plus, concerns like poor humidity can promote the development of mold, create skin and hair concerns, and a host of other undesirable problems. Your indoor air quality is straight related to the total comfort and security you experience in your home, so making sure that your air is safe and healthy is big offer.

<p>Equipment costs are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your house heater. Low-efficiency models will cost less, however lead to higher energy bills. High-efficiency models cost more, however conserve more over the long run. Prices for gas heating systems vary from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models as much as $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric furnaces start at $395 and range approximately $1,700 or more depending on the brand and furnace size.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
