But according to a cybersecurity professional at a big merchant who asked not to be named since he did not have consent to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a team that regularly keeps track of energy intake and temperature levels in shops to save on expenses (particularly at night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the shops change beyond an acceptable range that could avoid clients from shopping at the store.<p>
