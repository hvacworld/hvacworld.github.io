<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases exposure to toxins during cooking. Improper adjustment, often shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame idea is blue. Think about buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously if you buy a brand-new gas range or variety. Never ever utilize a gas stove to heat your house. Always ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
