<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power must not go beyond the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, because the overall capability of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outside system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, since it takes into consideration not only the small power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.
