<p>The predominant health result connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon.

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year.
