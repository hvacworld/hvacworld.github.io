<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your home, providing a comfy climate in every space. However ducts that are not installed appropriately or preserved can distribute impurities from one space to another. Over time, dust, dander and even mold can collect in your ducts, lowering the overall air quality. Hire a professional to ensure your ducts are circulating fresh, tidy air.<p>
