<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
