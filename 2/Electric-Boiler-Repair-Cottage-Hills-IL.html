<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math lately, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater since the service technicians believed they simply didn't seem ideal and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
