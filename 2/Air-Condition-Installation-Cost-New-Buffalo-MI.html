They weren't cheap but a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was really pleased they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
