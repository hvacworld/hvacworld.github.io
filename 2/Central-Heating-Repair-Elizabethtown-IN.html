<p>Aside from area heating, the geothermal heating unit can likewise be linked to a device called a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat created from the ground source heatpump compressor and uses it to heat water. This suggests that this device can also offer complimentary hot water for domestic use in addition to its standard geothermal heating and cooling purpose.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
