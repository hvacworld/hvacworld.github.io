The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air pollution amongst the leading five ecological health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>Since an ac system moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean up the condenser coil.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
