<h3>Residential HVAC in Willard NC</h3>
<p>House heating unit are made complex systems that require the services of a contractor to set up. While you can certainly purchase your furnace yourself, many contractors will not warranty the furnace or might not install it if you don't purchase it from them. Installation costs vary across the county, however begin at approximately $50 per hour approximately $150 or more. It takes roughly five hours to install a little furnace and more to install a large one.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
