<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2.

After extensive trials in Arizona, where the system had to keep scientists and their equipment cool and dry, our innovation is now prepared for extra-terrestrial duty.<p>
