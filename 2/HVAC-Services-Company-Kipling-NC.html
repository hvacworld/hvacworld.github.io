<p>. Before choosing the installation place of air conditioning unit, a number of main factors need to be thought about.

Second of all, there ought to not be any barriers on the way of the air flow that may avoid it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outside system must also be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from your home will not be effectively released outdoors and the productivity of the whole system will drop greatly. It is extremely recommended to set up the air conditioning system systems in easily accessible places, for further maintenance throughout operation.<p>

<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
