<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, as opposed to outside or commercial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure.

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being clogged with debris that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down completely. By contrast, replacing a furnace and checking filter can normally be done in simply a couple of minutes, often without any tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
