<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can manage, so many Seattleites must find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as soon as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a cruel, harsh summer season.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
