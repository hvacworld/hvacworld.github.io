<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Fort Recovery OH</h3>
<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while simultaneously eliminating waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it increasingly tough for your lungs to work appropriately, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>Because an a/c moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept clean. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
