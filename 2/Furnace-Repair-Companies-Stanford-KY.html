<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heater. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperatures reach and drop below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which immediately shut down the heat pump. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>The general duties of an HVAC technician consist of installing, preserving, and repairing refrigeration, air, and heating systems.

<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment at Stanford KY</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor unit rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
