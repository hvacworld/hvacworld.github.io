<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be effectively vented and cleaned from the furnace routinely. Modification the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned up due to the fact that the soot develops inside the ducts, lowering their efficiency gradually. Anticipate to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
