<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Important Company in Los Angeles. Switched to utilizing Wachoff's about a year earlier and they have actually been to your home for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced fairly, have actually handled the one repair I required well, and are always on-time and expert.

<p>When our furnace was dying, we called 2 local companies for quotes. While both were informative and useful, Ballard Gas provided us a better deal, for remarkable service. Rather than an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heating unit and located methods we might have more even heat. He included these small but considerable changes in his bid. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump because of recent warmer summer seasons and for environmental reasons.<p>
<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
