<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
