<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it. Any air flow constraint will lower the unit's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
