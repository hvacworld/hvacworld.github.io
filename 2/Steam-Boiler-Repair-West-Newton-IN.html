<p>A vehicle's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being dirty and old.

A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>

Like lots of intricate situations, there's most likely more than one right answer. You may even wind up taking a tip from one HVAC contractor, even if she or he is not the person who winds up with the job.

<p>Consider potential results of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the manufacturer's directions, particularly directions on the proper fuel and keeping the heater properly adjusted.

While an area heater remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the rest of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
