<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
