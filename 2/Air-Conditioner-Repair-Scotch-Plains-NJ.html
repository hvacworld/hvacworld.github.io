<p>Collins Aerospace ventilation systems improve your flight experience by supplying fresh air, improving food safety and cooling your flight-essential and flight-critical electronics. An alternative to packaged systems is the use of separate indoor and outside coils in split systems Split systems are chosen and commonly used around the world except in The United States and Canada. In North America, split systems are frequently seen in residential applications, however they are gaining popularity in small commercial structures. The split systems are a terrific choice for little buildings where ductwork is not practical or where the space conditioning effectiveness is of prime issue. 19 The benefits of ductless air conditioning systems consist of simple installation, no ductwork, higher zonal control, flexibility of control and peaceful operation. citation required In area conditioning, the duct losses can represent 30% of energy intake. 20 Making use of minisplit can lead to energy savings in space conditioning as there are no losses related to ducting.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like a space heating unit) with the exact same quantity of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
