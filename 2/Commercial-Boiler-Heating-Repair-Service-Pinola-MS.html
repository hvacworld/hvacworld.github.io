Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage.

<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to big commercial and office complex such as high-rise buildings and hospitals, automobiles such as automobiles, trains, ships, airplanes and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are controlled with regard to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ might discover musty or unpleasant smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak with your doctor about them. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>

There is currently no proof, however, that a reasonable variety of houseplants remove considerable amounts of toxins in workplaces and houses. Since overly wet soil might promote the development of microorganisms which can affect allergic individuals, indoor houseplants must not be over-watered.<p>
