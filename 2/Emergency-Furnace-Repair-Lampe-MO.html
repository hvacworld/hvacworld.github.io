<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has become an important issue to homeowners and health specialists. Indoor air pollution studies have determined a number of impurities that can be present in indoor air. These consist of combustion products, volatile organic substances (consisting of formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Proper ventilation and removal of the sources of these impurities are essential in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
