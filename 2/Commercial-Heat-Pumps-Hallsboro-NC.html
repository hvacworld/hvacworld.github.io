<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to provide enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
