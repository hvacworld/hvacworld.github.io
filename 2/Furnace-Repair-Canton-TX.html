<p>We got in touch with Elite HVACS on among the most popular days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to examine scenario & decided to choose them for the work. I enjoy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but also changed the heating system which was old. Everyone we spoke with from starting to end were very professional, polite and the work was extremely effectively done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and filthy.

A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
