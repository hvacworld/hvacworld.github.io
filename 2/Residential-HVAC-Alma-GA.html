<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
