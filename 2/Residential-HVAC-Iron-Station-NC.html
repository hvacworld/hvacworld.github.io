What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
