<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, however a property owner does not have the tools or skills required to check refrigerant levels.
