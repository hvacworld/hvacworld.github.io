<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit.

That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
