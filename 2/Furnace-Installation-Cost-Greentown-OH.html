<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
