<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not position the condenser under a deck or completely confine it due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top. Any air flow restriction will decrease the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>

<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heaters were not working, stability Energy was quick to respond. They showed up the next day and replaced two furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new heating systems can heat the house. Honestly, our house heating unit is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
