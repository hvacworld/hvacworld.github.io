<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature level. Heating systems that kick on often may be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
