<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

This should work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>

For example, human beings breathe out carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not poisonous, however may become harmful if high concentrations are permitted to build up. Micro-organisms or germs may likewise exist within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the whole work environment or building by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
