The requirements do not require you to change your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services must still be available for your house's systems.

Forced air systems will require a water-to-air heatpump while hydronic radiant heating systems will need water-to-water heatpump. The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop needed depends on the cooling and heating requirements for your home and is important iin making sure the performance and efficiency of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is determined in tons. Normally, a 3-ton setup should be sufficient for the typical house, but home size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land schedule are all factors which will influence the correct size for your particular home.
