<p>The function of many building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building security at affordable energy expenses. Load computing is referred to as the Manual J estimation and need to be performed by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or system cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video alone.
