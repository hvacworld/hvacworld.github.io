<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
