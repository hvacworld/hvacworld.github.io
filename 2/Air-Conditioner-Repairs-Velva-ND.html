<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
