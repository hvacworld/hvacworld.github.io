Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure products, smoking, home items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating systems.

Since they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Since an unit is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
