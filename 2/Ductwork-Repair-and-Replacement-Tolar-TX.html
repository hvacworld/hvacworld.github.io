<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
