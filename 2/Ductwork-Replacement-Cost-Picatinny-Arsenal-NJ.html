<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
