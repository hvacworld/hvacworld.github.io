Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
