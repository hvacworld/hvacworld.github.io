The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power must not surpass the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, given that the overall capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces may not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, since it considers not only the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
