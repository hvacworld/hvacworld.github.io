These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
