<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an uncommonly high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had actually identified the difficulty area in looking over the expense. He solved the concern in one day, had adjusted the expense to what I considered reasonable before he recalled, knew what might have triggered the problem and had a strategy to insure that it would not take place once again.
