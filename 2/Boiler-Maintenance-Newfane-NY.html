<p>Throughout typical furnace operation, dust, dirt, moisture from humidity or condensation, and microbial growths can develop on internal components. Airborne elements from typical household products and surface areas can cause formicary corrosion within your HVAC equipment. Left unattended, these issues can lead to loss of efficiency and even worse, breakdown of component products and a shorter furnace life-span In time, crucial elements like the heat exchanger, burners or blower housing can begin wearing away, resulting in lowered efficiency.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
