<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more efficient than space air conditioning system. In addition, they are out of the way, quiet, and convenient to operate.
