<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more efficient than space air conditioning system. In addition, they are out of the way, quiet, and convenient to operate. To save energy and cash, you must shop an energy-efficient air conditioner and minimize your central air conditioner's energy use.
