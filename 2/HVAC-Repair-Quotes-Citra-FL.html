Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the service technicians thought they just didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
