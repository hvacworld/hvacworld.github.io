<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern.
