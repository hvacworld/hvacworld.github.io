<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system.

When the a/c works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
