<p>Choosing the right size a/c unit is an essential part of the HVAC purchasing procedure and one that you'll need an HVAC expert to assist you with. Here's why purchasing the right size air conditioning unit matters: if you purchase an HVAC system that's too huge, you'll wind up squandering money and energy. And if it's too little, you will not get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfortable.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
