<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
