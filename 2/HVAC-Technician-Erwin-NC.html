All five other companies quoted me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is truthful, trusted, and affordable on price. It's tough to find an honest AC person and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
