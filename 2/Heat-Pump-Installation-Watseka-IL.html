<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>A geothermal desuperheater is really effective and beneficial, particularly during the Summer season while the system acts to cool one's house. This is due to the fact that the excess heat soaked up from within the house is performed into the hot water tank instead of being sent back into the earth. The result, therefore, is totally free hot water! Additionally, during winter season, the heat from underground can be taken in to heat domestic water alongside its primary purpose of providing space heating. This means that cost savings are still understood throughout the chillier period. In reality, a desuperheater minimizes winter season water heating expenses by roughly half.<p>
