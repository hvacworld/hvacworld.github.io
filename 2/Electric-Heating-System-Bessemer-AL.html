<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have respiratory problems, winter season can intensify issues. Stale indoor air and heating unit can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too cold to throw open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it's important to be knowledgeable about some of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that may be prowling in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Usually the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions.
