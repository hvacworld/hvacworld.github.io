For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
