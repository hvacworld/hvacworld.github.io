<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Greendell NJ?</h3>
<p>In the last a number of years, a growing body of scientific evidence has actually shown that the air within houses and other buildings can be more seriously contaminated than the outdoor air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research study suggests that people spend around 90 percent of their time indoors. Therefore, for many individuals, the risks to health may be higher due to direct exposure to air contamination inside your home than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
