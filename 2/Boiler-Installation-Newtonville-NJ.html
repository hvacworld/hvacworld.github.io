<h3>Furnace Repair Cost in Newtonville NJ</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
