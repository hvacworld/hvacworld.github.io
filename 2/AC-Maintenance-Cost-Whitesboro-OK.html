According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
