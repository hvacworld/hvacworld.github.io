<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big retailer who asked not to be called because he did not have approval to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps track of energy intake and temperature levels in shops to save on expenses (particularly in the evening) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the stores vary outside of an acceptable range that could avoid customers from shopping at the store.<p>
