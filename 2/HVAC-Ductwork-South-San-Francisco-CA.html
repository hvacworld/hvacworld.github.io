<h3>AC Maintenance in South San Francisco CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are particularly at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke causes nose, throat, and eye irritation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Lots of AC systems come with a number of unique functions that can even more enhance performance and effectiveness. For example, house owners may wish to look for one that includes a built-in filter light that will notify you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular function to search for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to minimize energy costs even more. Naturally, more features mean higher central air conditioning costs.<p>
<p>Occupants of homes with bad indoor air quality may complain of signs such as headache, eye irritation, fatigue, dry throat, sinus nausea, dizziness, and congestion. Since many illnesses can cause these signs, diagnosing sick building syndrome is difficult. Exceptionally high levels of some impurities, such as carbon monoxide gas, can cause more severe disease, consisting of death.<p>
