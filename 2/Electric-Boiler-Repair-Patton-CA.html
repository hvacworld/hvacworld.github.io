<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>Air ducts are accountable for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your home, offering a comfortable climate in every room. However ducts that are not set up properly or preserved can distribute impurities from one space to another.
