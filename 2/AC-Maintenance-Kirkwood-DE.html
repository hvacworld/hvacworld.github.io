<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
