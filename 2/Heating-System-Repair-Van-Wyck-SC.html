<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large merchant who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that consistently keeps an eye on energy usage and temperatures in shops to save on expenses (especially during the night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the stores fluctuate outside of an appropriate range that could prevent clients from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>My eldest child constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it actually didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did previously. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t really think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is itÃ¢ and low $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
