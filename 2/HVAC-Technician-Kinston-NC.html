<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>The main reason property owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the amount of services provided.
