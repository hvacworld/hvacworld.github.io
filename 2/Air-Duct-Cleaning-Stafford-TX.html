From one of the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some fundamental maintenance.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
