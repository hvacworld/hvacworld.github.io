<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by several thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is extremely crucial to preserving a proper temperature level.<p>
<p>Particular types of HVAC systems are a bit more expensive than wall units, ceiling or cassette systems are neatly hidden inside the ceiling in the class and are for that reason more discreet and aesthetically pleasing to look at.

Ducted commercial-grade cooling systems are BETTER for the instructional environment. They are typically the most costly option; however, they are also the most visually pleasing as the duct-work and internal units hidden with very little visibility.<p>

<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S).

Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
