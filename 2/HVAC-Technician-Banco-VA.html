Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high indoors may cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of co2 in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
