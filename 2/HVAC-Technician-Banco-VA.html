Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high indoors may cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of co2 in most structures.
