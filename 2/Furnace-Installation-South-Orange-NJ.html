HVAC experts recommend following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>More common in fairly older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electrical energy, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private spaces. All-electric boilers can achieve approximately 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE.

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
