<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Camarillo CA</h3>

It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
