<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as near the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow greater airflow from the outdoors, air quality monitoring platforms and sensing units, and new air purification technologies are ending up being more typical as readily available solutions in commercial and residential HVAC product packages.

Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
