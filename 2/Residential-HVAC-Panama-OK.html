<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is much more than other heat pump types when setting up the entire system. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Installing one included excavation, running numerous backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is rather costly. Setting up a new geothermal heat pump to deal with an existing ground loop is far cheaper.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but your house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
