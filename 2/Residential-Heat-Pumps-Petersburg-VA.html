<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
