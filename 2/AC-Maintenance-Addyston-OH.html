<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
