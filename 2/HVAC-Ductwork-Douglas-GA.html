Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
