<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, a number of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>The steadiness of the market's development does not always translate to the experience of operating an HVAC company. The ventilation, heating and air conditioning organisation tends to run cold and hot. When clients need their HVAC systems repaired for relief versus the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather gets here, need heats up throughout the summer and winter season.<p>
