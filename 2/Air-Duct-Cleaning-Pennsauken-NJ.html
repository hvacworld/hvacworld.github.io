<p>A health survey need to be established and dispersed to all worried employees. Such a tool ought to identify the variety of people affected; define ages and task descriptions of involved workers; identify where they lie within the workplace; indicate when the signs take place (time of day, day of week, and season); supply a list of specific health symptoms or health problems; identify all devices run in the office; show the kind of outdoors air pollution; and recognize potential sources of task tension.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
