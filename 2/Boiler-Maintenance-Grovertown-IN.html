<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
