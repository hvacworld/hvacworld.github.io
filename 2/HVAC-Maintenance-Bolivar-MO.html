<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and final flooring surface. This is generally used in a 2nd or third-floor  area and benefits from the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
