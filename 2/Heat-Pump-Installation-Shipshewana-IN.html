<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
