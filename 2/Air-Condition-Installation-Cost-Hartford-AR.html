<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and offices matters, particularly because we spend most of our lives inside. Ac system assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in very damp climates or in cases where the a/c is oversized, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the ac system will require more energy to cool your home.

If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably simple process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>
