<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in location. Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or ac system don't just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repeated usage of an element that is out of balance.
