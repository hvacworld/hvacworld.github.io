Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
