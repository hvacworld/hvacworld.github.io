<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
