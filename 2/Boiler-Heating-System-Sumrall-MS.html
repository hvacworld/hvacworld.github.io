<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large seller who asked not to be named because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a group that routinely monitors energy usage and temperatures in shops to save on expenses (especially during the night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the stores fluctuate outside of an appropriate range that might prevent consumers from shopping at the store.<p>

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
