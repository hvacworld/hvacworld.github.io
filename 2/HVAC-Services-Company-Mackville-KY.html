<p>Since the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they make more efficient. This was initially driven by increasing energy expenses, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues.

If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
