<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Maintenance in Locust Grove GA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 ought to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be set up to offer threshold alerts. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your monitoring equipment to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to resolve the scenario immediately.<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may position threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
