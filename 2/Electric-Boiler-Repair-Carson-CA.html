Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide should be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
