<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
