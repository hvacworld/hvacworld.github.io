<p>The main reason house owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the quantity of services offered. If the system is new and still under a manufacturer's service warranty, the cost may not be rewarding. Any significant repairs ought to be covered under the producer's guarantee. Nevertheless, some manufacturers need regular maintenance as a regard to the service warranty.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
