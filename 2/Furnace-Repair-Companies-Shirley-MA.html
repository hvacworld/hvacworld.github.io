<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>

This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heater (like an area heating system) with the exact same quantity of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
