<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>

When the air conditioning unit works however your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
