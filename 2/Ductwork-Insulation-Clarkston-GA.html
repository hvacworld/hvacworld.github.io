<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search validated WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a referral later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4).

The female crimp connectors should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight.
