<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable influence on residents-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
