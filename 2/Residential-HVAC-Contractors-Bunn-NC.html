<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. Therefore, a professional service individual must be required practically any maintenance aside from regular cleaning. Central air conditioners should be professionally inspected and adjusted prior to the start of every cooling season. However, do not let your maintenance end with this annual examination. While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system running at peak efficiency.<p>

Occupational exposure limits listed in health and safety guidelines and the Threshold Limitation Worths ® (TLVs) recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are meant as a guide to avoid illness or particular results (like eye and nose inflammation) in commercial circumstances. These limits might not be appropriate in workplace settings or for the house.<p>
