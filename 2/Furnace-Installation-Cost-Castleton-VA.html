<h3>Air Conditioner Repairs Near me in Castleton VA</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.

Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
