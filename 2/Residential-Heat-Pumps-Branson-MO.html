<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Branson MO</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
