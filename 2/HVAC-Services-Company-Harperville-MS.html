<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that frequently, our nationally representative survey discovered. Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen area variety hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
