<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, since the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally just offered for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing just a cooling system.
