<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
