<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have been revealed to cause the health results pointed out. Nevertheless, it is not always real that the results kept in mind happen at the pollutant concentration levels generally found in the house. In most cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health results is too limited to identify the levels at which the listed impacts might occur.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
