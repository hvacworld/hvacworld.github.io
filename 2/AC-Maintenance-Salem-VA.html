When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue.
