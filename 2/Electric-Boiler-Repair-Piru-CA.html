<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, however to have two major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>When setting up the whole system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.

<h3>Heater Repair in Piru CA</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the tools or abilities required to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the needed devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
