<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become air-borne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline allergen might induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
