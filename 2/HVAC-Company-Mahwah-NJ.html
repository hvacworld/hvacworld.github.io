<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
