<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
