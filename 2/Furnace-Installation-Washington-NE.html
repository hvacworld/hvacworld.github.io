<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance gos to per year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and usually some other benefits.
