<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4).

The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight.
