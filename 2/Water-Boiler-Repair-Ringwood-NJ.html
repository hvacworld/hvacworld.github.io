<h3>Solar Heating System in Ringwood NJ</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>
