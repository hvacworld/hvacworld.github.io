<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, a lot of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item.
