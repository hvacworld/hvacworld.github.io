<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
