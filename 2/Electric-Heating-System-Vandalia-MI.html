You can likewise examine the filter to ensure it is clear of dirt and examine the standing pilot burner to ensure it is lit.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Second of all like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively.

Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the system has actually been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
