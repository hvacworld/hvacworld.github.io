<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Immediate results may appear after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant effects are treatable and typically short-term. Sometimes the treatment is just removing the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Signs of some diseases, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also show up not long after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being airborne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat irritant could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, however not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the 2 must not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for generating power in the type of electrical power. The 2 operations utilize different procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated up to boiling point to attain its goals.<p>
