<p>Enhance your services, make more services profits, and supply an amazing client experience. To ensure the unit you select is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load computation quote to identify the specific type of heat and air conditioning system that's perfect for your home-we do not simply change it with the exact same size unit you presently have. These calculations consider things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is important so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses oil, gas or electricity to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in private rooms. All-electric boilers can achieve as much as 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must accomplish 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers need to achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are breathed in, they can build up and remain in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal).
