<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
