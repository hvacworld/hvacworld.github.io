<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
