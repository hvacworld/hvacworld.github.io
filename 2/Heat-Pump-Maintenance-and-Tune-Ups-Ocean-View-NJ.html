<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
