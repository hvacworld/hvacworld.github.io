<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
