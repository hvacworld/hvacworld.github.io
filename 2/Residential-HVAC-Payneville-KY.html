<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
