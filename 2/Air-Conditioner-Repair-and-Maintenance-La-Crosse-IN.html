<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
