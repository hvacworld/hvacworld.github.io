<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>Apartments can have the same indoor air issues as single-family homes because a number of the pollution sources, such as the interior building materials, home furnishings, and household items, are comparable.

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your automobile.

In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. When every three months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
