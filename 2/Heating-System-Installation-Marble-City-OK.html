<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My partner said that she had actually seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent people I have met in a long period of time. We need to support the genuine people who are there for us if we desire to have options to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
