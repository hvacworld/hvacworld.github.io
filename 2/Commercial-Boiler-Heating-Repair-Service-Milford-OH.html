<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known fact that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is simply as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will frequently build up in ductwork, limiting air flow.

If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly simple process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

<p>While radon in water is not an issue in houses served by a lot of public water products, it has been discovered in well water. If you've checked the air in your home and found a radon issue, and you have a well, contact a laboratory certified to determine radiation in water to have your water evaluated.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>

<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne.
