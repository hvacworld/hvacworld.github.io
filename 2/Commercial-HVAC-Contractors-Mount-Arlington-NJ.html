<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally triggered by the absence of sufficient ventilation, which results in an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the primary problem in over half the workplace indoor air investigations it has actually carried out. Investigations conducted in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the exact same to be true. These examinations revealed that proper ventilation is essential in maintaining great indoor air quality.<p>

<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat allergen might induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, however not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-term indoor air quality problem is produced merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complicated issues-- identified by regularly unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, among the three strategies listed below might be suitable.<p>
