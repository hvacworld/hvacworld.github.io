<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
