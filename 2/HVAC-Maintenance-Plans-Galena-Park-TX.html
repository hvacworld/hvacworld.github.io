They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.
