<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Ferndale PA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
