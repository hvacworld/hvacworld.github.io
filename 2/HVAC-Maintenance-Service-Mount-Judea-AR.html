For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in place. Moreover, the concrete results of a PM is frequently difficult to quantify, as one reaction stated the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early degeneration, causing cracks and holes. , if that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the component.. an extremely useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
