<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly lowers direct exposure to toxins during cooking. Incorrect modification, often indicated by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you acquire a new gas stove or range, think about buying one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously. Never ever utilize a gas stove to heat your house. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>
