While setting up a separate split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
