<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Air conditioning system can create a lot of water due to the fact that they eliminate wetness from the air.

In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location.
