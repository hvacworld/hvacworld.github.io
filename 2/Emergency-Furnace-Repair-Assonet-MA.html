<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

Soil by highways and roadways might be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks that used leaded gas. Usage door mats to wipe your feet before getting in the house. Change your clothes before you go house and wash these clothing individually if you work with lead in your task or a pastime. Motivate your kids to play in sand and grassy locations rather of dirt which sticks to toys and fingers. Try to keep your kids from eating dirt, and make sure they wash their hands when they come inside.<p>

<p>Geothermal heatpump are very efficient, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is always at a continuous temperature. These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just achieve an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling result. A lot of ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for every unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
