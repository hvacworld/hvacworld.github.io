<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible in many cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores.

<p>There are two main types of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating service. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to resist existing, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
