<p>Though it might be hard to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your house, but there are many other toxins that can not only dirty up the air, but cause other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure products add to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unstable organic substances) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery products can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
