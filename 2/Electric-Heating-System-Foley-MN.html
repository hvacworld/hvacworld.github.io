<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics lately, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
