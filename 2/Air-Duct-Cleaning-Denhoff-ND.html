Breathing air contaminants can result in asthmatic and allergic reactions, infections and other illness that include the lungs, nose and throat.

Pre-owned smoke is also damaging to individuals, specifically children.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in gathering information on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to momentarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and offered clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
