<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.
