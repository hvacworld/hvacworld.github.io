For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power counts on regular sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a trusted and available source of energy.<p>
