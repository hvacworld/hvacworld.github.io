<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they should be placed. The majority of commonly they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if individuals primarily remain seated in that specific location. However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate toward the floor or ceiling; depending on what pollutant you're attempting to track you'll need to place the sensor appropriately. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside structures are normally near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>
