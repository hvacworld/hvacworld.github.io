<p>Designed to enhance manufacturing process control in a printing plant, Carrier's invention managed not just temperature level but also humidity Carrier utilized his knowledge of the heating of things with steam and reversed the process. Rather of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and therefore the quantity of wetness in the air might be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the room manageable. The regulated temperature and humidity helped preserve constant paper dimensions and ink positioning. Later on, Provider's technology was applied to increase performance in the work environment, and The Provider A/c Company of America was formed to meet rising need. In time, air conditioning came to be utilized to improve comfort in autos and houses too.<p>

My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
