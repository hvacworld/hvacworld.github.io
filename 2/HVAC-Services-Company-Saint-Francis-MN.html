The only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day.

He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
