These firms might also need recommendations on which ENERGY STAR equipment is the very best matched for the size of a freshly built home.<p>
<p>Before you go out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioner be? Too big and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioner and shorten its life. Too small and your a/c unit will not have the ability to cool your house properly. When going shopping for a new AC system, these are simply a few of the elements that you need to take into account.

Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.
