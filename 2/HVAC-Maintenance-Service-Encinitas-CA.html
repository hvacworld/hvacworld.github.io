Heaters that kick on regularly might be because of an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
