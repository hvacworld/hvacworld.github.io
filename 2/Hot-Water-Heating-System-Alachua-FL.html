<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
