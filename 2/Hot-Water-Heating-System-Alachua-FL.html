After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness.

In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
