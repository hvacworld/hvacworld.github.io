<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your cooling system from flooding. One of the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on rare events.<p>
