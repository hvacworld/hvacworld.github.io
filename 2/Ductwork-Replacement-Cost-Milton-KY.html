Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
