<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
