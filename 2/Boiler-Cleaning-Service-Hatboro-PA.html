This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

This is typically used in a third-floor or second location and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour.
