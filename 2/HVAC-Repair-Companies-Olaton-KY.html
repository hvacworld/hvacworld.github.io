<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the task based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier.

<p>There's a huge distinction between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical type of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of houses in cooler environments were warmed by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the ceilings, walls and floors heated up. In turn, the things in the room, like furniture and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
