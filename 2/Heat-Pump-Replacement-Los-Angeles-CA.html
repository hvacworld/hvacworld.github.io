<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room.

We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.
