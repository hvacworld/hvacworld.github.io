<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
