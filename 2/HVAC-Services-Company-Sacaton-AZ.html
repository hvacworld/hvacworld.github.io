<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

If we do choose to provide auto debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
