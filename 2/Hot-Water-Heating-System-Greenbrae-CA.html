<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
