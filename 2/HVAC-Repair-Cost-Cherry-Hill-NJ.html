<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
