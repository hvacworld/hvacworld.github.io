This step is vital so the unit isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>

When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
