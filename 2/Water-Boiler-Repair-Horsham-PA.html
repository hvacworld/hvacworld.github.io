<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer.

<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units.

<p>A main consider the avoidance of health symptoms is an efficient, appropriately designed and running ventilation system. The ventilation system determines the quality of the indoor air by controlling the amount of air that is added to the office environment, the tidiness of such outside air, and the rate at which the office air and its pollutants are either tired to the re-circulated or outside throughout the building.<p>
