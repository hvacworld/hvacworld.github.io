<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, given that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.
