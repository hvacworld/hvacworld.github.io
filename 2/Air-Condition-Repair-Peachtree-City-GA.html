<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else restricting the circulation of air.

<p>Asthmatic children are especially at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke causes throat, eye, and nose irritation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually linked exposure to secondhand smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>While contaminants commonly discovered in indoor air are accountable for lots of damaging results, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are essential to produce particular illness. Individuals also react extremely in a different way to exposure to indoor air contaminants. Further research is needed to better understand which health effects take place after direct exposure to the average pollutant concentrations found in homes and which take place from the higher concentrations that take place for brief time periods.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to supply adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
