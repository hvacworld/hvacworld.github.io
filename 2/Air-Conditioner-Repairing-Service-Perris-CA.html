<p>In-floor heater can come with particular health advantages. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you simply can't seem to heat up and find you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses throbbing. In-floor heating systems are not susceptible to this issue since they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Furthermore, since they do not rely upon fans, ducts, returns and signs up to distribute hot air, in-floor heater can decrease the quantity of dust and seasonal allergens in your house.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
