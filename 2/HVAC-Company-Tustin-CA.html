Others were nearly twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider.

New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
