<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Just a specialist can precisely detect why your furnace isn't starting. It's time to call a professional if at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems odd or you lose confidence. Likewise, if the process does not work, something else is incorrect and you need a technician to analyze the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you need to do it regularly, it's probably time for a professional viewpoint.<p>
