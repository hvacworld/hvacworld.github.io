<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Boles AR</h3>
<p>UW workers, students and visitors should have a clean, healthy environment in which to work, study and carry out various activities. If the air quality is bad it can affect an individual's health, performance, and convenience.  The function of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to offer and preserve healthy and comfortable environments free of pollutants. A key part of the program is reacting to and resolving concerns of building residents about issues in their work environment.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, irritation, and irregular breathing might be induced as the result of temperature level extremes, improper humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation. Workplace temperature levels need to be maintained in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts caused by excessive air blood circulation need to be avoided.<p>
