Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation.

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.
