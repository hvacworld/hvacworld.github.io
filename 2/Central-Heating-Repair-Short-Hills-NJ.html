<p>All houses need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been stressed out from use. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature level. Heating systems that kick on frequently may be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
<p>Apartments can have the same indoor air issues as single-family houses due to the fact that many of the contamination sources, such as the interior building materials, furnishings, and household items, are comparable.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
