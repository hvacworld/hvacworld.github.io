<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, given that the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, because it considers not only the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Outdoor pollutants. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and irritants discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Experts advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and usually are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
