<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
