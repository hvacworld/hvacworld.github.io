<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
