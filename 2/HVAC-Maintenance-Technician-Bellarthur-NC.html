<p>There are many actions a property owner can require to select items that will avoid indoor air issues from occurring - a number of them are mentioned here. First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, consider using solid wood items. Second of all, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make certain that an efficient wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it becomes wet.<p>
