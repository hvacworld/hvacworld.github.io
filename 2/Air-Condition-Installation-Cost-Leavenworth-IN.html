<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold might be living in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and cooling system.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
