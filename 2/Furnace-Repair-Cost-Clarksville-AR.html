<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A good place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's type of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI certification know that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one component (out of lots of) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
