<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that frequently, our nationally representative survey discovered. Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
