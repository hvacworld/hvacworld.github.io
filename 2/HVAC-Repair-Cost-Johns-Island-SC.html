<h3>How to Limit the Costs of Air Conditioner Repair at Johns Island SC</h3>
<p>Elements that can contribute to the growth of biological contaminants are wet or damp structure products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and poorly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are animals and household plants.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
