<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is generally greater than many heat pump options, they can still be extremely efficient, depending upon the model you acquire. One of the primary advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperatures than other heating choices. This means it can heat up your house to the desired temperature quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
