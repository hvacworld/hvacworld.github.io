<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German innovation". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to produce a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-404a and r-410a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is currently widely used in residential refrigeration.<p>

<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Experts recommend utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, however greater MERV levels trap smaller particles and normally are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
