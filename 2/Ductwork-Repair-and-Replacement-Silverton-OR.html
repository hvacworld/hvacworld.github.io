<h3>AC Replacement in Silverton OR</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is honest, trustworthy, and affordable on cost. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC person and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for property owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself however likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, given that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are typically only offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best choice for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
