<p>My eldest child constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
