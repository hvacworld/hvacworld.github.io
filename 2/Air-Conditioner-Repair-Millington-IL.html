<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ¬∞ C (40-55 ¬∞ F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
