In the summer season, the process reverses, thus cooling a house by eliminating heat.

<p>A geothermal desuperheater is very effective and beneficial, particularly throughout the Summertime while the system acts to cool one's home.

Furthermore, throughout winter season, the heat from underground can be soaked up to heat domestic water alongside its main purpose of supplying area heating. This implies that cost savings are still realized throughout the colder duration. In fact, a desuperheater lowers winter water heating costs by around half.<p>
