<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, search for indications of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can suggest your house might not have adequate ventilation consist of wetness condensation on walls or windows, smelly or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become moldy.
