<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
