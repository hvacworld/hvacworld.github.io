<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and offices matters, particularly given that we spend most of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the a/c is large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the ac system will need more energy to cool your house. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>

<p>To be sincere, few of the facilities supervisors who use our indoor air quality monitoring service came to us for that reason.
