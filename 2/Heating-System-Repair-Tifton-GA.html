Much like other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling impact.

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
