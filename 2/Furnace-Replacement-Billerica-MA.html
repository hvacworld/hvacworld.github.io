<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't use contracts.  The so called trusted companies rip off more people than the fly by night clothing. I understand due to the fact that I attempted to work for them. I stop since 90% of them are crooks. They walk in with or without an agreement and start selling you things you don't need. They lie. How do I understand. I now work as an expert to confirm the so called remedies and issues. 9 out of 10, I inspect are totally incorrect.<p>
<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was sort of unusual being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
