Proper ventilation and removal of the sources of these contaminants are very important in maintaining excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.
