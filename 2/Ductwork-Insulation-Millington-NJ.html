<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a recommendation later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
