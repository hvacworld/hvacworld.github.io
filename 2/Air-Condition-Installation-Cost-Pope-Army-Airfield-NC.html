<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>If it's time to update an aging AC, variable speed is the method to go. Already planning to change an existing air conditioning unit?

When used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
