<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Kaysville UT Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating system. We selected getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
