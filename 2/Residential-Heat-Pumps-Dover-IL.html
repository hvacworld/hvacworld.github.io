These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types.

When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
