<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ.

<p>Variable speed is the method to go if it's time to upgrade an aging AC. Already planning to change an existing air conditioning unit? Presuming your budget accommodates a variable speed system, you must absolutely get one! You'll feel more comfy throughout the summer months, and your indoor air will be great deal cleaner.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
