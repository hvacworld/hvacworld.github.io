<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Most people understand that outdoor air contamination can affect their health, but indoor air contamination can likewise have substantial, harmful result. EPA studies of human direct exposure to air contaminants indicate that indoor levels of contaminants might be two to 5 times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air contamination amongst the leading 5 environmental health risks to the public.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
