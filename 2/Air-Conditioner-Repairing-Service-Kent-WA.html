<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers toxins from indoor air (revealed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (expressed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends upon preserving it according to the maker's directions.<p>

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is incorrectly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust from outdoor sources, consisting of polluted soil tracked inside, and use of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down quickly. This is a very typical repair. If your furnace is more than ten years old and youâ $ re having actually other service done on it, think about having the ignitor and flame sensing unit changed as preventative maintenance due to the fact that the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
