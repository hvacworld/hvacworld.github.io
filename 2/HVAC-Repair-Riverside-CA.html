<p>The function of most structure ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing safety at sensible energy costs. Load computing is referred to as the Manual J estimation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or system cost for air conditioning. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based upon experience or on square video alone, transfer to another contractor. As with measuring the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, figuring out the correct size of system for your home also depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
