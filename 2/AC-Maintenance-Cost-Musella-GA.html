<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
