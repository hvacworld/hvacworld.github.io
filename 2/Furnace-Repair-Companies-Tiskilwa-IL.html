<p>Measurement procedures are being developed and demonstrated to examine building ventilation and indoor contaminant concentrations. These treatments vary from sophisticated tracer gas approaches used mainly in building research study efforts to less involved procedures that can be utilized by building operators. NIST researchers are continuously establishing new test procedures, and after that showing them in the field to assess their feasibility and reliability. The efforts in which these treatments are shown in the field has resulted in the development of a crucial database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 must be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Often a short-term indoor air quality problem is produced simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complex problems-- recognized by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, one of the 3 tactics listed below might be suitable.<p>
