The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a big effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- right away, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
