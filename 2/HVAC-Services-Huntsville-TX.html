<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Huntsville TX</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>As you typically require to use a self-leveling substance on top of the electric underfloor heater, you should factor in the time it considers this to totally dry before the floor covering can be put in place - this is normally a day or more.
