<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>

<h3>AC Unit Repair in Northridge CA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
