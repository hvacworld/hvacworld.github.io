<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems at Cedar Valley UT</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in home building is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, floorings, and walls. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps tire them from the house.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 need to be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
