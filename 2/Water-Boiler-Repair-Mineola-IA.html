Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
