<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>We advise utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by functioning as a very efficient thermal barrier.
