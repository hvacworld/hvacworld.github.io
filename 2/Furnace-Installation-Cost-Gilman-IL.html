<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, much of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
