<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
