<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heat.<p>

<p>A/c can develop a great deal of water because they remove wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
