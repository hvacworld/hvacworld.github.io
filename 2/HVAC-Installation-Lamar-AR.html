<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, nowadays. While many individuals presume contamination is just an outside issue, your house (and workplace) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we don't think adequate about direct exposure to all the things we place in our houses," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.

<p>Specific types of HVAC units are a little bit more pricey than wall units, ceiling or cassette systems are nicely hidden inside the ceiling in the classroom and are for that reason more discreet and aesthetically pleasing to look at.

Ducted commercial-grade air conditioning systems are BETTER for the instructional environment. They are typically the most costly option; however, they are also the most aesthetically pleasing as the duct-work and internal units concealed with very little visibility.<p>

<p>A/c can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine.

The heat can be moved to the surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
