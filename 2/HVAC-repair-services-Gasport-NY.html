<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
