<p>New a/c generally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score implies higher energy efficiency and potentially lower energy bills. A good SEER ranking for you depends on your house size, where you live and other elements. Even the minimally permitted SEER score is going to be a lot more energy efficient than your present, old ac system. It's not always about selecting the design with the highest SEER ranking, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealership can help.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is much more than other heat pump types when installing the entire system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one involved excavation, running hundreds of lawns of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is rather expensive. Installing a new geothermal heatpump to work with an existing ground loop is far less expensive.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a normally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see Ac system Leaks Water, below.<p>
