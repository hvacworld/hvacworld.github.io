<p>Professional heater installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists advise following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new.
