<p>Consumer items which contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to trigger cancer in animals. Likewise, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide in the body and can cause symptoms associated with direct exposure to carbon monoxide gas.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>If your single stage air conditioning unit isn't old enough to validate replacement, consider an entire house dehumidifier. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single phase system, you can delight in some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and allowing higher comfort at higher temperature levels.<p>

For example, people breathe out co2, which in small quantities is not hazardous, but might become harmful if high concentrations are allowed to accumulate.
