<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power ought to not exceed the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, considering that the overall capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not easy, since it takes into consideration not only the small power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
