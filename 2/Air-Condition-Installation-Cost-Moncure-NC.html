<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>

However, presuming they are set up properly and properly looked after, the possibility of them having problems is little.<p>
