<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
