Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
