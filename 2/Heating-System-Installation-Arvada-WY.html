<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump, along with all other kinds of heat pumps, have effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or COP. It's a clinical way of identifying how much energy the system moves versus how much it uses. A lot of geothermal heatpump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This means for each system of energy used to power the system, 3 to five systems are provided as heat.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
