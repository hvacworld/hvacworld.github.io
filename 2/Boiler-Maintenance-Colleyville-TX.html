<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible in most cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores.

More severe than many allergenic properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes in persons that currently have asthma, a major respiratory illness.<p>
<p>The compressor can shut and overheat down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience periodic durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still does not work effectively after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work completely unless you do this.<p>
