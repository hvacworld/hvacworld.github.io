<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Dupo IL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We decided on getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenses. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
