<p>Seattle heating systems can run 9 months of the year. Based upon the typical temperature levels in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a cars and truck it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life-span of 15 years. Your heating system will work hard for you, but like your car, doing routine and regular maintenance will keep it running smoothly, avoid problems, and keep your service warranty intact.<p>
<p>Though it might be tough to think, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other contaminants that can not only unclean up the air, but cause other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building products add to bad air quality, and can likewise trigger cancers. VOCs (unstable natural substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery products can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that often, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen area range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
