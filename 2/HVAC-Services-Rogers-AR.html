<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes oil, electrical energy or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers must achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers need to accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
