<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While space air conditioning supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
