<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money can be found in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..

<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
