<p>Make certain there are no rugs, furniture, or anything else restricting the circulation of air. Not just will obstructed vents and registers impact your comfort, they can likewise result in duct leakages due to extreme atmospheric pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused spaces is NOT an excellent idea. You will not save any extra money and will end up causing more problems for your heater.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater.

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level.

To avoid CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outside air should be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
