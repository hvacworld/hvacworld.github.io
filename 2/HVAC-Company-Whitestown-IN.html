<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
