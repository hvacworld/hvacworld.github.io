<p>We recommend using our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by functioning as a really efficient thermal barrier.

By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
