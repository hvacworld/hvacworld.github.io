<p>For whole home installations, it's tough, if nearly difficult, to retrofit a convected heat system in an existing house, specifically a hydronic system. Localized radiant floor heat systems to be used in one or numerous spaces like restrooms, kitchen areas or laundry rooms are easily renovated with electric glowing floor heat.

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
