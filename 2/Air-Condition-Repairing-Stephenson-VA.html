<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Stephenson VA Home</h3>
<p>If you need furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else might come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to order it. My better half said that she had actually seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent individuals I have actually met in a very long time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the genuine people who are there for us. Please do.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
