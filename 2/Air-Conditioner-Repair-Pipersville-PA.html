<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for several years. However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly appear greater than regular, it is probably time to think about a new system.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that unexpected shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>
