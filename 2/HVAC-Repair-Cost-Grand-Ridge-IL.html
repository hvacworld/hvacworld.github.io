<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
