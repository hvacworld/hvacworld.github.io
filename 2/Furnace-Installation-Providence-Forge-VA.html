<h3>Choosing the Right Company For Heating and AC Systems in Providence Forge VA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
