(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
