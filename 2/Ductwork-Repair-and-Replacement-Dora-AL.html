<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>
