<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
