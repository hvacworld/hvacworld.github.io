<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor.

Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>

They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, although it was six months before the current one ended. She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
