<p>The exhaust outlets enable all unsafe gases to escape your home so there's no risky accumulation of carbon monoxide and other such gases.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 ought to be calibrated often, and outside measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>
