<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
