<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
