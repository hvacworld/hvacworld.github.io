<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Verona</h2>

<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. Simply put, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heatpump run on electricity and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like a space heating unit) with the exact same amount of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
