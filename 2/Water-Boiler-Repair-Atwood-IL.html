<p>There are two main forms of radiant floor heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating organisation. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are forced to resist present, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI certification understand that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one element (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size.
