<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are delicate to indoor irritants or have breathing issues, winter season can intensify problems.

In late winter and early spring, it may still be too chilly to toss open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it is necessary to be familiar with a few of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that may be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
