<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
