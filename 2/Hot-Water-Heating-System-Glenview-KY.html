<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside workplaces, schools, and other workplaces is very important not only for workers' convenience but also for their health.

<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Glenview KY</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
