<h3>Boiler Installation in Peak SC</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

Preventive steps consist of adjusting typical hot water levels to enable 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, examining center style layout, removing faucet aerators, and periodic testing in suspect areas.<p>

<p>Integrity Energy fasted to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced two furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the brand-new heating systems can heat the house. Truthfully, our home heating system is complicated, Rob and his group fixed the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
