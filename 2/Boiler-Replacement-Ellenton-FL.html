<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes.
