Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy.
