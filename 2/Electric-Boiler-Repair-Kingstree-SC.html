<p>Indoor temperatures are often more challenging to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
