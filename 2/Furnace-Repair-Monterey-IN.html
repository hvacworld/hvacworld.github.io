<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may affect the health of individuals who reside in the house. Pollutants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground listed below. An air toxin might likewise originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care items.
