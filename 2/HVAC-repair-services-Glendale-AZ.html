Naturally, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of germs and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
