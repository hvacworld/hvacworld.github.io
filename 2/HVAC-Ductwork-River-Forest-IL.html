<p>Expert heating unit setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately fail. HVAC experts recommend following this basic rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's best to buy new.

If your house is not heating up, only be worried. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working effectively, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you need to call in a professional to inspect and repair the system.<p>

The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area.
