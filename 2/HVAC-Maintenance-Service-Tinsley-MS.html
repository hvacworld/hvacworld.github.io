<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Necessary Service in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% effectiveness or better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which might be ranked as low as 80% effectiveness, this can indicate considerable savings in annual heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase efficiency even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.

This indicates that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
