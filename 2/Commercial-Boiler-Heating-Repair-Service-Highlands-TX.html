<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your home still heats up to the best temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heatpump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel very hot. Just be worried if your home is not heating up. However, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice.

<h3>Wall Air Conditioner in Highlands TX</h3>
<p>As an experienced HVAC specialist, we suggest you have your systems checked and routine maintenance performed twice each year, as soon as in the Spring (prior to cooling season) and as soon as in the Fall (before heating season). It goes without stating the safety and comfort of your family or workplace staff are necessary aspects. Keeping what is most likely the most crucial and pricey system in your home (cooling and heating) correctly maintained will help keep your biggest investment of your life in good shape.<p>
<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperatures drop and reach listed below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which immediately shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of moisture from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM.
