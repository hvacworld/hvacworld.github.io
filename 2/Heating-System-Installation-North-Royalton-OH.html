<p>A vehicle's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being filthy and old. The old coolant will adversely impact the system's performance. To ensure the system is working efficiently, consider having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your automobile's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
