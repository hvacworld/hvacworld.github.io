Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely grateful to have a heated home once again. What's most remarkable was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week!

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>A/c unit can develop a lot of water since they remove moisture from the air. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler.
