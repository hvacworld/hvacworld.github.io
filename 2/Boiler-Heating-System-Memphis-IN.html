<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Memphis IN</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
