<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
