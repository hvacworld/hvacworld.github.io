<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
