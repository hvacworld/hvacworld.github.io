<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- offer All Vovo a call! Heatpump work very well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electrical power, a heat pump is an economical option utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, however in reverse.

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>The heatpump acquired popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can draw out heat from various sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground.

A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly.
