<p>Recently, Target informed reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial intrusion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were taken from a 3rd party vendor. Sources now inform KrebsOnSecurity that the vendor in question was a refrigeration, air and heating  conditioning subcontractor that has worked at a variety of locations at Target and other leading sellers.<p>
<p>Utilize experts and treat them well: Motivated, well-compensated experts perform much better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. An ethical company does not make use of inexpensive labor chances just because they're inexpensive. Low-cost craftsmanship is typically inferior workmanship, and it never helps a company develop long-lasting relationships with clients.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

If left disregarded, a furnace is susceptible to breakdowns, effectiveness concerns, and disastrous failures, which could lead to severe emergency situations.
