<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. When the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and cure-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
