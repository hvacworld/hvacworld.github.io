<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, occasionally linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home.
