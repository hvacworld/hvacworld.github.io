<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper.

When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
