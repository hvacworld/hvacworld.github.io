Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
