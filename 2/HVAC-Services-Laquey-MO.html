<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had spotted the difficulty location in looking over the expense. He resolved the concern in one day, had actually changed the bill to what I thought about reasonable before he recalled, understood what might have caused the issue and had a strategy to insure that it would not occur again. I have thought about All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have utilized them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a firm eventually.
