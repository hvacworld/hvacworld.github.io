You do not conduct repairs by yourself pipes system, or replace your own electrical grid. The reasons that you do not do those things are obvious. You don't have the tools, or the know-how, to be sure that you perform those procedures safely and correctly. Specialists, nevertheless, do have the tools and competence to do the job appropriately. A/c repair is no various. You always wish to employ a professional to repair your system, so you can have the comfort associated relying on an expert in the field.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place over time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
