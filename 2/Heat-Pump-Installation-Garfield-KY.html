<p>Not all sensing units work the very same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring equipment will send the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it via software application. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results through a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to decipher.<p>

Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
