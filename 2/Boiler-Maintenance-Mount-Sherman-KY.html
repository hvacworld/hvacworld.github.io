R-600 (isobutane) is currently widely used in residential refrigeration.<p>

No additional charge.<p>

<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly cure and solidify-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
