<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

They satisfied my requirements totally by offering an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing extra products.
