When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
