Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.

<p>I generally do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
