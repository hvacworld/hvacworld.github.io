<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
