<h3>Ventilation System in Pleasant Garden NC</h3>
<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by a lot of public water supplies, it has been found in well water. If you've tested the air in your house and discovered a radon problem, and you have a well, contact a laboratory licensed to measure radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon issues in water can be readily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, however a homeowner doesn't have the skills or tools needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the needed devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still required to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
