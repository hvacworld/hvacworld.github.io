<p>Variable speed is the way to go if it's time to upgrade an aging AC. Already planning to replace an existing a/c unit? Assuming your spending plan accommodates a variable speed unit, you should definitely get one! You'll feel more comfy throughout the summer months, and your indoor air will be great deal cleaner. At least, consider a two stage compressor for improved comfort and efficiency.<p>
<p>Oil heaters are typically not very effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however many do not achieve an efficiency greater than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more pricey, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation as well since a drain needs to be installed.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that perfect temperature all year round.
