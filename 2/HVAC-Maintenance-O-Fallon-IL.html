<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heat pumps run on electrical power and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like a space heating unit) with the exact same amount of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
