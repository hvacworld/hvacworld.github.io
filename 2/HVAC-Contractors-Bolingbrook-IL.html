According to figures gathered by Angie's List, homeowners can anticipate to pay between $6 and $16 per square foot, not consisting of tax and labor, for a radiant heat system.)

In some testing, even the tile broken when the system was run before the compound had treated. And mortar makers might refuse guarantee coverage if you do not follow their instructions.<p>
