Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
