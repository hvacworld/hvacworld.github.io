<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is often important to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such details can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking information from the employer.

However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping track of data may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
