<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
