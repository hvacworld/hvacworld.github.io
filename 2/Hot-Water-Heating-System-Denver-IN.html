<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC system is not working. The copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's most likely your issue. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning devices if you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The simplest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
