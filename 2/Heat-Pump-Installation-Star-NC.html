<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Star NC</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Martin stated the company is prepared to put down roots" in the Tri-Cities and expects to have a team of about seven to 10 staff members when it unlocks on the new center by early fall.

<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work up until you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
