<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen with time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
