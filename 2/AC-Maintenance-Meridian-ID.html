<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic.

Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<h3>Advantages Of Hiring AC Repair Services at Meridian ID</h3>

Similar to other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0.
