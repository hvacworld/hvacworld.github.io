<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Fantastic AC Repair Company in North Vernon IN</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in automobiles in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>
