<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
