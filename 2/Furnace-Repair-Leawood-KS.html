<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in gathering information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.
