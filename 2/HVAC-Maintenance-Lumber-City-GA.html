<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of individuals who live in the house. Toxins could come from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care items. Bacteria and viruses, animal dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out fixing the issue, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
