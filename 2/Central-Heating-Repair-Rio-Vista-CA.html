<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>
