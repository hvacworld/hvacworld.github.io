<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Infected central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
