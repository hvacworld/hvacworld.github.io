<p>We're spending a lot more time indoors, these days. While lots of people presume contamination is just an outside issue, your home (and office) can likewise be contaminated. As a society, we ensure that our houses are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we don't think sufficient about exposure to all the things we put in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and structures has a big effect on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- right now, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA). Here's how to breathe easier.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air.

Momentarily increasing ventilation coupled with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be useful in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
