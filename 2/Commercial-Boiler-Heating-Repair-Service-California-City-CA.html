<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold might be living in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and cooling system.

Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
