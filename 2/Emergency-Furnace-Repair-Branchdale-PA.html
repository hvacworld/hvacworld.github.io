<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Branchdale PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
