<p>Health center running theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to decrease infection danger and the humidity controlled to restrict patient dehydration. Although temperature levels are frequently in the comfort variety, some expert procedures, such as open heart surgical treatment, require low temperature levels (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, fairly heats (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F).

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not offer them.  Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the unit has actually been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
