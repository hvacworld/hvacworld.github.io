<p>Central air systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is generally higher than numerous heat pump alternatives, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the design you buy. Among the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating choices. This means it can warm up your home to the desired temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
