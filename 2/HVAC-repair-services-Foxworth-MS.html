<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time.

<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for property owners to think about. Many times, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, since the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
