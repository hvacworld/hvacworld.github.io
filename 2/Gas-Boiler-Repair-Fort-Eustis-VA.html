<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
