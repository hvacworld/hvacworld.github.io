<p>Particular instant results resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often tough to figure out if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is very important to take notice of the time and place the symptoms occur. If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is far from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort needs to be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some results may be intensified by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions common in the house.<p>
<p>Whatever heater you install, it's vital that it's sized correctly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should.

Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>
