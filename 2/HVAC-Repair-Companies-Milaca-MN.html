<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s below package to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built.

Direct exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon becomes trapped in structures and concentrations build up inside your home.<p>
