<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Loma Linda CA</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a really enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
