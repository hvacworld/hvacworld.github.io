<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Questa NM</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<h3>HVAC Repair in Questa NM</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and reasonable on price. It's hard to discover a sincere AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>When you purchase a new cooling and heating system, you're investing in your home, your household, and your service.

They also perform all service work on my rental homes as well. When they say they will and the pricing is competitive, their techs show up. They put in the time to discuss the repairs and make tips on how you can make your system more energy and cost efficient. If you need HVAC work, provide a call, you will not be disappointed.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that regularly, our nationally representative survey found. Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never clean their humidifier or kitchen variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
