<p>The very first air conditioners and refrigerators employed toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Similar to most house improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heating unit can vary commonly based on the size of the house. A lot of heaters will last in between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, homeowner need to think about heat output and performance. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace ought to be matched to the size of the house. A small house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and shut down for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
