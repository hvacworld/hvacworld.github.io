<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely uncommon now.

Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan starts. If  it does not, you have actually provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
