Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>

When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects.
