<h3>Gas Furnace Repair in Hodgenville KY</h3>
<p>Some HVAC service technicians offer service agreements to their customers, supplying regular maintenance of heating and cooling systems.

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Hodgenville KY</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes much more serious with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are typically installed in tandem with a more traditional form of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heat pump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
