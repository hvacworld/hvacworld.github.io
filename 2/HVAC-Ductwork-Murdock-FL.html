<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan.
