<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a simple and efficient  method to reduce ambient air contamination and possible health dangers, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can range from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air toxin arising from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burnt. Older homes might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In bathrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can become a problem where moisture levels are normally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, people breathe out carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not poisonous, but may end up being harmful if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Bacteria or micro-organisms might likewise exist within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the entire work environment or structure by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
