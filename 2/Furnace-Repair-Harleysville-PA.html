<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to supply enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
