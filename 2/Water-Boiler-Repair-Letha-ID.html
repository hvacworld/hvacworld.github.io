And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
