<p>If no contaminant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air.
