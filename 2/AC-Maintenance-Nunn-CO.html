<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While space cooling provides optimum versatility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
