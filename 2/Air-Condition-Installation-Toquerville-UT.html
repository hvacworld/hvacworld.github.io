<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
