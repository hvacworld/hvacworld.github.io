<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Hazlehurst GA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate because it just takes more electrical power to run a larger system. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
