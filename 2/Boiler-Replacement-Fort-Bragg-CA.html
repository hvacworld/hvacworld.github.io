<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. However, brand-new installation practices are minimizing expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to traditional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
