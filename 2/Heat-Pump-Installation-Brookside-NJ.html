<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy.

Micro-organisms or germs may also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they may spread out throughout the entire workplace or structure by means of the ventilation system.<p>
