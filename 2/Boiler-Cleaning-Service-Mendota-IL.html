<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Mendota IL</h3>
<p>Biological pollutants: the biological impurities can consist of bacteria, viruses, fungis (mold), allergen allergen, animal dander, insect bio fragments, fiberglass and fibers, pollen, cockroach allergen, etc. and may arise from insufficient maintenance and housekeeping, water spills, insufficient humidity control, condensation, or may be brought into the structure by residents, infiltration, or ventilation air.

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
