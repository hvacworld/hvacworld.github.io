<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
