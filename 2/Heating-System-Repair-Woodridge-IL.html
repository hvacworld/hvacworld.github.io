<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%.

<p>Use or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common technique of lowering direct exposure to indoor air contaminants, also will reduce but not eliminate exposure to ecological tobacco smoke.
