These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions require.

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow.
