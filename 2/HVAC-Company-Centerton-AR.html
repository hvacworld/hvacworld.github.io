<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
