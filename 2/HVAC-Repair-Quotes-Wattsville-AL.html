<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been appropriately dried. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
