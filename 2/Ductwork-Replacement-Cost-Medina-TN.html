<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

This is generally utilized in a third-floor or 2nd area and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put.

<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly reduces exposure to contaminants during cooking. Incorrect change, often shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue. Consider buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you buy a new gas stove or variety. Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your house. Always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
