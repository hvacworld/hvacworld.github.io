<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up.
