<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins.
