<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service contract tries to upsell you every time they concern perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months before the existing one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
