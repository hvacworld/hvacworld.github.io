The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
