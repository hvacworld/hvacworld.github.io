<p>The residential or commercial properties and composition of the soil in a location can impact the rate at which heat is performed through the ground. These must be considered before picking the best style of an underground heating & cooling system. Soil with positive heat transfer properties needs less pipes to attain the desired underground cooling and heating result, while those with reduced thermal conductivity will need more pipes.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
